## INDICATIONS
65-year-old female patient is here for an ERCP procedure for the evaluation and treatment of choledocholithiasis.

## HISTORY
Patient reports 2 weeks history of right upper quadrant pain and jaundice. She's been having right upper quadrant pain and jaundice for around 2 weeks.
No history of pancreatitis is reported unless otherwise specified. Current medications include aspirin and metformin.

## MEDICATIONS
Aspirin and metformin.

## MONITORING
Monitored anesthesia care is provided.

## DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE
After the risks, benefits and alternatives of the procedure were thoroughly explained, informed consent was verified, confirmed and timeout was successfully executed by the treatment team. With the patient in the left semi-prone position, medications were administered intravenously. The duodenoscope was passed from the mouth into the esophagus and further advanced from the esophagus into the stomach. From the stomach, the scope was directed to the second portion of the duodenum.

## ERCP QUALITY METRICS
Pancreatic duct cannulation Not attempted.
Cannulation success: Yes.
Post-ERCP pancreatitis prophylaxis: No.
Rectal indomethacin: No.
Successful completion of intended procedure: Yes.
Failed ERCP from another facility or provider: No.

## FINDINGS
A scout film of the abdomen was performed.

The duodenoscope was advanced to the second portion of the duodenum without difficulty and without detailed examination of the upper GI tract. Not described were seen.

The major papilla was identified. It appeared normal in position and morphology, with an intact orifice and no surrounding erythema or edema.

The minor papilla was not inspected.

The ampulla was identified and found to be normal.

Bile duct cannulation was successful.

Contrast was injected under fluoroscopic guidance and cholangiogram was performed. Multiple stones in the distal common bile duct, largest measuring approximately 12 mm.

Adjunct stone therapy was performed due to multiple stones, large stones (largest 12mm). Initial extraction was attempted with balloon. This was partially successful but a large 12mm stone remained.

Endoscopic papillary large balloon dilation was performed after sphincterotomy. A CRE balloon balloon was used with target diameter 12mm. Inflation was performed using graded stepwise strategy for 60 seconds. Balloon waist was present and resolved. Overall outcome was adequate papillary orifice enlargement achieved.

Final assessment of duct clearance: complete.
All visible stones and sludge were removed. Bile and contrast drained well into the duodenum through the papilla.
A final fluoroscopic image was obtained for confirmation.

Sphincterotomy was performed.

The scope was then completely withdrawn from the patient and the procedure completed.

Specimens removed: None.

Complications: There were no immediate complications.

## IMPRESSIONS
1. Normal major papilla and ampulla appearance
2. Multiple stones in the distal common bile duct, largest measuring approximately 12 mm
3. Successful biliary sphincterotomy and stone extraction after papillary balloon dilation

## RECOMMENDATIONS
1. Follow up pathology results.
2. Finish IV fluids now.
3. Pain control as needed.
4. Proceed with Cholecystectomy; can remove stent after Cholecystectomy tentatively in 3 months.
5. Follow up with referring provider.
