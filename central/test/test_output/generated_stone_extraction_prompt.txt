I am giving you a transcript from an ERCP procedure. The task is to extract procedure entities, focusing on stone extractions.
The information you extract will be used to fill a structured procedure note template.
If examples of the template are given, ensure your extracted field fits with that structure. For instance, field "scope_advancement_difficulty_reason" will be used to fill in the template sentence "Scope advancement was challenging due to {scope_advancement_difficulty_reason}", so your answer should be a phrase that fits in that sentence.
If examples of valid responses are given, you may also write free text responses outside those examples, unless otherwise specified. Ensure the free text responses have the same grammatical structure. 
Unless otherwise specified, default to string type outputs.
Not all fields may be mentioned in the transcript or applicable for the procedure. Unless explicitly otherwise specified, if you do not know the answer, record "unknown". If it wasn't mentioned or if not applicable, record "none". Do not make up information.

The entities you must extract are listed below. Follow the instructions.
###ENTITIES############################
stone_extraction_performed: true/false if stone/sludge extraction performed and/or adjuncts used
stone_indications: If adjunct stone therapy was performed, record all reasons for it as a string, e.g. 'large stones (largest 9mm) and duct tortuosity'. Not exhaustive list, be specific if possible:
- giant stones (largest ≥15-20mm)
- large stones (largest >10mm)
- multiple stones
- heavy stone burden
- distal CBD narrowing/papillary stenosis
- duct tortuosity/angulation
- failed balloon sweeps

initial_method: What was used for initial stone extraction attempt, e.g. 'balloon', 'basket', 'combination'
initial_result_text: Describe as a sentence, initial stone extraction result before any adjunct techniques, e.g. 'Complete clearance was achieved.
eplbd_performed: true/false if performed; if not mentioned, false
eplbd_sphinc: If epldb done after sphincterotomy, record 'after sphincterotomy'. If done without sphincterotomy, record 'without sphincterotomy' and the reason why; e.g. 'without sphincterotomy because of bleeding risk'.
eplbd_balloon_type: Balloon type used
eplbd_target_diameter: Target diameter in mm
eplbd_inflation_strategy: 'graded stepwise' or 'single-step'
eplbd_duration: In seconds, usually 30, 60, 90
eplbd_waist_resolution: Status of balloon waist during inflation, e.g. 'present and resolved', 'partially resolved', 'persistent'
eplbd_outcome: 'adequate papillary orifice enlargement achieved', 'partial enlargement', 'inadequate enlargement'
eplbd_adverse_events: Describe any bleeding, perforation, or other complications in a sentence
mech_lithotripsy_performed: true/false if performed
mech_lithotripsy_indication: All reasons mechanical lithotripsy was performed, e.g. large stone, impacted stone, failed balloon
mech_lithotripsy_basket_system: Type of basket system used, e.g. 'mechanical lithrtripter basket'
lithotripsy_location: Location of stone where lithotripsy was performed, e.g. distal CBD, hilum
mech_lithotripsy_stone: Characteristics of stone, e.g. hard/calcified, soft, faceted
mech_lithotripsy_outcome: Outcome of lithotripsy, e.g. 'Complete fragmentation achieved'
mech_lithotripsy_basket_impaction: If basket impaction occured, describe impaction type, the rescue performe, and the outcome of rescue in sentences
mech_lithotripsy_adverse_events: Describe any adverse events from mechanical lithotripsy in a sentence
chol_lithotripsy_performed: true/false if chololangioscopy-guided lithotripsy performed
chol_lithotripsy_platform: Cholangioscopy platform used, e.g. 'SpyGlass DS II'
chol_lithotripsy_modality: Lithotripsy modality used, e.g. 'EHL', 'laser'
chol_lithotripsy_target_stones: Describe target stones of chololangioscopy-guided lithotripsy, including number, location, size
chol_lithotripsy_irrigation: true/false if saline irrigation used
chol_lithotripsy_fragmentation: Outcome of fragmentation, e.g. 'complete', 'partial', 'unsuccessful'
chol_lithotripsy_debris_clearance: Methods used for debris clearance after lithotripsy, e.g. 'balloon sweeps'
chol_lithotripsy_details: Describe any additional details about settings or shot counts
stone_therapy_limitations: Any limitations during stone therapy, e.g. 'poor visualization due to bile/pus/blood'
duct_clearance_status: Final assessment of duct clearance after stone therapy as 'complete', 'near-complete', 'partial', 'failed'
duct_clearance_narrative: Describe the findings and management based on the final duct clearance status in sentences, e.g. 'All visible stones and sludge were removed.', 'Small non-obstructing stone remains, expected to pass', 'Failed clearance due to distal narrowing'
staged_strategy_narrative: If partial/failed clearance, describe in detailed sentences the staged strategy if planned, including indication, stent type/size/position, drainage quality, and plan
stone_therapy_complications: Complications during adjunct stone therapy, e.g. bleeding, perforation, extravasation, cholangitis worsening
stone_therapy_bile_drainage_narrative: Describe how and how well bile and contrast drained after stone therapy, e.g. 'Bile and contrast drained well into the duodenum through the papilla.'
fluoroscopic_img_obtained: true/false if final fluoroscopic image obtained after stone therapy

###FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS############################
The transcript may have spelling or transcription mistakes; use your domain expertise of endoscopy to correct them before recording an answer. If there are self-corrections for a finding later in the transcript, include only the most recent correct information. For example, if the transcript has: 'There were no masses or polyps found. But I'm checking again and I now see a 6 mm polyp in the transverse colon.' The second statement is a correction. The actual polyps size in mm you should record is 6.
Follow the instructions for each field carefully; record none/unknown for unknown/NA fields.
Return the result as a JSON file. Do not return any additional comments or explanation.
