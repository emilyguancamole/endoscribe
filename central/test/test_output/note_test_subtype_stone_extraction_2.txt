## INDICATIONS

## MEDICATIONS
Refer to record of source.

## MONITORING
Johns Hopkins Standard.

## DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE
After the risks, benefits and alternatives of the procedure were thoroughly explained, informed consent was verified, confirmed and timeout was successfully executed by the treatment team. With the patient in the left semi-prone position, medications were administered intravenously. The duodenoscope was passed from the mouth into the esophagus and further advanced from the esophagus into the stomach. From the stomach, the scope was directed to the second portion of the duodenum.

## FINDINGS
A scout film of the abdomen was performed.

The duodenoscope was advanced to the second portion of the duodenum without difficulty and without detailed examination of the upper GI tract. The esophagus, stomach, and duodenum appeared unremarkable on limited inspection.

The major papilla was identified.

Bile duct cannulation was unsuccessful.  The procedure was terminated.

Contrast injection was not performed.

Adjunct stone therapy was performed due to multiple stones, large stones (largest 12mm). Initial extraction was attempted with balloon. Initial stone extraction was partially successful but a large 12mm stone remained.

Endoscopic papillary large balloon dilation was performed after sphincterotomy. A CRE balloon balloon was used with target diameter 12mm. Inflation was performed using graded stepwise strategy for 60 seconds. Balloon waist was present and resolved. Overall outcome was adequate papillary orifice enlargement achieved.

Final assessment of duct clearance: complete.
All visible stones and sludge were removed. Bile and contrast drained well into the duodenum through the papilla.
A final fluoroscopic image was obtained for confirmation.

The scope was then completely withdrawn from the patient and the procedure completed.

## RECOMMENDATIONS
1. Finish IV fluids now.
2. Pain control as needed.
3. Follow up with referring provider.
