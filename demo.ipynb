      " Today is the 17th of September, 2024, and I'm Dr. Venkat Akshintala here at the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center, and I'm performing an ERCP on an 84-year-old female who presents for a follow-up evaluation of choledocolithiasis and bile duct stumps. The patient has a past medical history significant for pulmonary embolism, for which she is on warfarin and a seizure disorder. She previously presented with biliary colic and jaundice and the CT scan showed a large common bile duct stone about 9 x 18 mm with intrahepatic and extrahepatic ductal dilation. She underwent ERCP in October of 2020 which revealed dilated CBD nurturing 12 mm with a mid-CBD building defect. During the procedure, a small biliary sphincterotomy and a 10 mm balloon sphincteroplasty was performed. Multiple stones were extracted using a stone retrieval balloon. 10 x 40 mm fully covered metal stent was placed at a time for further ductal decompression. She is now returning for stent removal. IV sedation has been administered and the patient and I'm now commencing the procedure. Now I'm beginning the procedure and I'm advancing the Olympus TJFQ 180B duodenoscope through the mouth, passing it into the esophagus, which appears normal, and further into the stomach. which also appears normal at limited use. I am advancing the scope to the second portion of the duodenum. A scout film obtained prior to insertion confirms the presence of previously dilated biliary metal stent. I am now visualizing the major papilla where the fully covered metal stent is in still. Using rat tooth forceps, I am successfully removing the biliary stent without resistance. The previous biliary centratomy is widely patent. I am now deeply cannulating the bile duct using a stone retrieval balloon preloaded with 80.035 inch 450 cm guide wire. The guide wire advances easily into the intraphatic ducts. I am now performing a cholangiogram which reveals a dilated CBD measuring 12 mm but with normal appearing intraphatic ducts. This degree of CVD dilation is likely acquired. I'm now going ahead to perform multiple balloon sweeps, inflating the balloon to 12-15mm starting at the bifurcation and sweeping distillate. A small amount of sludge is removed during the sweeps. The 12mm balloon passes freely through the bile duct with no resistance. There is excellent contrast drainage following the sweeps. At this point, I'm withdrawing the scope completely. The estimated blood loss is none. There seem to be no immediate complications. And this is the end of procedure.\n",
