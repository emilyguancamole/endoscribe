ERCP transcript:

'We have 58 year old male for an ERCP with stent exchange, follow up of bile duct structure. 'After confirming informed consent, the patient is positioned in the left semi-prone position, intubated and sedated under anesthesia. 'I now pass the diurnoscope to the mouth. ' advancing carefully through the oesophagus and into the stomach. 'The visualized portions of the oesophagus and stomach appear normal. 'I advance the scope further into the second portion of the duodenum. 'On scout imaging, a previously placed biliary stent is seen with a common bile duct ' the major papilla is identified in the second portion of the duodenum. 'I see a visible stent emerging from the papilla with evidence of a prior sphincterotomy. 'I am using a snare to remove the previously placed stent and the stent removal is successful. ' Next, advance a sphincterotome with a guide wire and achieve easy cannulation of the common bile duct. 'Deep cannulation is confirmed. 'Contrast injection is now performed and the cholangiogram reveals a short, mild stricture in the mid-common bile duct. ' It's consisted with a non-anastomotic structure. 'The appearance is improved compared to prior imaging. 'I'm using a 12mm stone extraction balloon. 'I sweep the bile duct twice. ' I've removed the debris from the duct. 'Contrast drainage is noted though slightly sub-optimal. 'Given the findings, I proceed to place a 10 French by 9 centimeter Boston Scientific ' Advanix Rapid Urinal Bend Piliary Plastic Stent across the stricture site. 'One stent is deployed successfully with good drainage observed. ' Now the scope is completely withdrawn from the patient. 'The procedure is completed without difficulty. 'Estimated blood loss is none and there are no immediate complications. 'No specimens are obtained from the procedure.
