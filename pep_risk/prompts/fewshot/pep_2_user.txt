ERCP transcript:

'This is an ERCP with sphincterotomy and papillotomy performed on December 17th, 2020. 'We have a 49 year old female with a history of primary biliary cholangitis, elevated liver enzymes and chronic pancreatitis. 'She's recently admitted with acute abdominal pain. ' Prior imaging including CT abdominal and MRCP demonstrated pancreatic ductal dilation and structure with the possible pancreatic duct stone in the head of the pancreas. 'After explaining the risks, benefits and alternatives, informed consent was obtained and verified. 'Timeout was performed with the entire team present. 'The patient is positioned in supine position ' and it's intubated and serrated under anesthesia. 'I'm using a Pentax ED3490-TK duodenoscope. 'Now I'm introducing the scope through the mouth. 'It's passed through the esophagus and the stomach. 'Now being advanced into the second portion of the duodenum. ' A scout film obtained prior to scope insertion was unremarkable. 'On endoscopic examination, the stomach appears normal. 'The major papilla is identified in the second portion of the duodenum and is normal. 'Bile noted draining from the orifice. ' The minor papilla is located approximately in the second portion of the duodenum and is normal. 'Initial pancreatic duct cannulation is attempted using a sphincter tom with a guide wire. 'Cannulation is difficult, but superficial access is achieved. ' Bile duct cannulation is being attempted using a sphincter dome and a guide wire. 'We have achieved deep cannulation with ease, performing a cholangiogram. 'It reveals a normal biliary tree without any strictures, dilation or stones. ' With the guide wire in place, a biliary sphincterotomy was performed successfully. 'I repeat pancreatic duct cannulation again using sphincterotome and guide wire. 'Superficial cannulation is achieved and the guide wire is being advanced a short distance into the head of the pancreas. ' The contrast injection reveals a short branching pancreatic duct without upstream filling, suggest a possible stricture or incomplete diversion. 'There's multiple attempts to advance the wire upstream, but it's unsuccessful. ' The main pancreatic duct is scanulated with a tremor catheter. 'However, there is no pancreatic duct visualized with contrast injection. 'The binaural papilla is again examined and it's found to be normal. 'I am slowly retracting the scope. ' scope is completely withdrawn and the procedure is concluded estimated blood loss was none no specimens were obtained and there is no immediate complications
