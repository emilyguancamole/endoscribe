ERCP transcript:

Performing an ERCP with sphincterotomy and spike glass cholangioscopy on a 50-year-old female who is presenting for evaluation of liver enzyme elevation and a possible bile leak. The patient has history of bipolar disorder, possible COPD, she's got multiple spinal surgeries done, chronic opioid use for abdominal pain, multiple prior abdominal surgeries. She's a status post laparoscopic cholecystectomy in 2020 at an outside hospital, which was done for an emphysematous A. calculus cholecystitis. Her lap curly was complicated by bile leak and biliary obstruction. Interventional radiology placed percutaneous biliary drainage on 24th of July 2020, and stent surgery, which was later accidentally dislodged. She presents for EOS and ERCP evaluation. We are now commencing the procedure. IV sedation has been administered. I'm advancing the Olympus TJF Q180V duodenoscope through the mouth and passing it into the esophagus. Which appears normal in limited views. I'm advancing it into the stomach, contains solid food debris. I'm rotating the scope into the second portion of the duodenum. A scout film of the abdomen is performed which shows the presence of a surgical drain. The major papilla appears to be normal. I'm now proceeding with biliary cannulation. I'm using a sphincterotome preloaded with a 0.035 inch hydrojag wire. Contrast injection under fluoroscopy guidance shows a mildly dilated common bile duct. and a broke cut off of the CBD at the proximal middle level with no contrast flow at stream. I'm now performing a 6mm biliary sphincterotomy using ERB electrocardi with no bleeding that can be observed. I'm now advancing the spikeless digital cholangioscope and I'm examining the common bile duct and the common hepatic duct. The distal CBD appears to be normal. At the level of the CPD cutoff, there appears to be no intraluminal mass lesions that can be identified. A Visiglide 0.025 inch wire is what I'm using to probe the area, but I can't advance it any further. I'm using a contrast injection to confirm the contrast flow and the contrast injection confirms that there's no upstream contrast flow. Final cholangiogram confirms persistent obstruction of the proximal mid-CBD. Given these findings, I'm making the decision to repeat endoscopy tomorrow with EUS guided hepatic gastrostomy. Sorry, hepatic gastrostomy. That's what I said. Yeah, sorry. I'm not withdrawing the spikeless cholangioscope and duodenoscope. The estimated blood loss is minimal. The patient appears stable, procedure done.
