I am giving you a transcript from an ERCP procedure. The task is to extract procedure entities. 
The entities to extract are listed below with descriptions. If the description says "0/1", record "0" if false/not performed, "1" if true/performed.
Make sure you are accurate. If an entity is not clear or not mentioned in the transcript, record "N/A".

pancreatic_sphincterotomy: 0/1
precut_sphincterotomy: 0/1
minor_papilla_sphincterotomy: 0/1
failed_cannulation:	whether the procedure resulted in failed ERCP cannulation; 0/1
difficult_cannulation: whether the procedure had difficult cannulation; 0/1
pneumatic_dilation_of_intact_biliary_sphincter: 0/1
pancreatic_duct_injections: whether at least one was performed; 0/1
pancreatic_duct_injections_2: number of pancreatic duct injections performed. If no pancreatic duct injections were performed, this should be 0.
acinarization: 0/1
guidewire_cannulation: 0/1
guidewire_passage_into_pancreatic_duct: whether guidewire passage was performed; 0/1
guidewire_passage_into_pancreatic_duct_2: if guidewire passage was performed, number of passes performed. Each reinsertion or switch of guidewire is a new pass. If no passes were performed, this should be 0.
biliary_sphincterotomy: whether performed; 0/1
aggressive_hydration: true if and only if the endoscopist starts 2 liters of lactated ringers wide open. If these conditions are not met, false; 0/1
pancreatic_duct_stent_placement: whether pd stent was placed; 0/1
