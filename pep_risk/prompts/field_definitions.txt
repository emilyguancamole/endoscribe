I am giving you a transcript from an ERCP procedure. The task is to extract procedure entities. 
The entities you must extract are listed below with descriptions. If the description says "0/1", record "0" if false/not performed, "1" if true/performed.
Follow the instructions. Make sure you are accurate. If an entity is not clear from the transcript, record "N/A".

pancreatic_sphincterotomy: 0/1
precut_sphincterotomy: 0/1
minor_papilla_sphincterotomy: 0/1
failed_cannulation:	whether the procedure had failed ERCP cannulation; 0/1
difficult_cannulation: whether the procedure had difficult cannulation; 0/1
pneumatic_dilation_of_intact_biliary_sphincter: 0/1
pancreatic_duct_injections: whether at least one was performed; 0/1
pancreatic_duct_injections_2: number of pancreatic duct injections performed (integer). If no pancreatic duct injections were performed, this should be 0.
acinarization: 0/1
pancreo_biliary_malignancy: 0/1
guidewire_cannulation: 0/1
guidewire_passage_into_pancreatic_duct: whether guidewire passage was performed; 0/1
guidewire_passage_into_pancreatic_duct_2: if guidewire passage was performed, number of passes performed (integer). If no passes were performed, this should be 0.
biliary_sphincterotomy: whether performed; 0/1
indomethacin_nsaid_prophylaxis: whether rectal indomethacin was administered; 0/1 	
aggressive_hydration: aggressive (true) if the endoscopist starts 2 liters of lactated ringers wide open; 0/1
pancreatic_duct_stent_placement: whether pd stent was placed; 0/1
