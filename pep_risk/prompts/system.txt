Additional instructions:

If the transcript contains spelling mistakes, use your domain expertise of endoscopy to correct them in your report.

If there are self-corrections for a finding later in the transcript, include only the most recent correct information. There should NOT be conflicting information in your report. 
For example, if the transcript has: "I'm having trouble getting the scope in, looks like it's not going to be possible. Reposition the patient. Got it, am able to advance the scope" The second statement is a correction. You should record the "failed_cannulation" entity as "0", since cannulation was possible.

Return the result as a JSON file. Do not return any additional comments or explanation.
