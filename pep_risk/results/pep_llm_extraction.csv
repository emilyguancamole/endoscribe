'There was one stent in situ at the major site of the papilla that was successfully removed using a snare. 'The major papilla was seen within a medium-sized diverticulum. 'Prior biliary sphincterion was patent. ' The bile duct was deeply cannulated using a stone-stripped balloon pre-welded with a 0.035 inch x 450 cm guide wire. 'The guide wire was easily advanced to the common bile hepatic duct, but difficulty with advancing the right intrahepatic duct. 'A cholangiogram was obtained and revealed a normal biliary tree, including intrahepatic bile ducts. 'The CBD measured 4 mm. 'Multiple balloon sweeps with the balloon inflated 9 mm were performed, starting at the bifurcation ' and only minimal sludge was noted. 'Since there was difficulty in passing the guide wire to the left biliary system, a decision was made to use a cholangioscope to assess the biliary tree. 'The balloon cannula was exchanged for a cholangioscope, which was passed to a bile duct. 'The entire biliary tree, including the common bile duct, the common hepatic duct, right hepatic duct, and left hepatic duct, appeared normal. 'There was minimal erythema and friability of the biliary mucosa, and the proximal bile duct likely sent induced stasis changes. 'The left hepatic duct ' appeared narrower than the right, but there were no strictures, lesions, masses, or stones. 'The cystic duct stump was also visualized ending in a blind limb. 'No further interventions were performed. 'The scope was then completely withdrawn from the patient and the procedure was completed. 'Compression successful removal of prior blue plastic gluary stent. 'Balloon sweeps with moderate amount of sludge removed. 'Plangioscope showing normal appearing bile ducts and endorphin ducts. ' Major papilla with medium-sized diverticula. 'Recommendations follow up as needed.

11862-24,20251123_015909,"This procedure is an ERCP with sphincteronomy and papillotomy, ERCP with removal of calculus, ERCP with stent placement. 'The indication is for a 75-year-old female. 'Here for an ERCP treatment of abnormal liver function test, abnormal MRCP, and CBD stones. 'After the risks, benefits, and alternatives of the procedure were thoroughly explained, ' Informed consent was verified, confirmed, and timeout was successfully executed by the treatment team. 'With the patient in a supine position, intubated, and medications were administered intravenously. 'The Pentax ED3490TK duodenal scope was passed from the mouth into the esophagus and further from the esophagus into the stomach. 'And from the stomach, the scope was directed to the second portion of the duodenum. ' Stomach was normal on visualization. 'A scout film obtained prior to the endoscope insertion appeared normal. 'The major papilla was located in the second percentile abdomen. 'It was normal in appearance. 'Vial was observed draining from the papilla. 'Vial duct cannulation was attempted using a splinter term and guide wire. 'Cannulation of the vial duct was performed with ease. 'De-cannulation was successfully achieved. ' Cholangiogram showed CBD dilatation up to 15 mm, CHT common hepatic duct for 12 mm, and left and right hepatic ducts dilatation was present as well. 'There was a 0.8 mm filling defect in CBD with guide wire within the bile duct. ' With the guide letter in the within the bile duct, a biliar centroderm was performed. 'A stone extraction was attempted using a stone extraction balloon. 'The bile duct was swept several times. 'Sludge was removed from the bile duct. 'A single stone was removed from the bile duct. 'A black stone was retrieved. 'A balloon occlusion cholangiogram was performed and appeared normal without any evidence of stones or filling defects. 'A seven-fringe, five-centimeter coaxium and double pigtail biliary plastic stent was placed at the site. 'A single stent was placed. ' The scope was then completely withdrawn from the patient and the procedure was completed. 'There was no estimated blood loss or specimens removed. 'There was no complications. 'There was a normal, visualized stomach, dilated CBD and hepatic ducts, ruled out clitoral cysts, CBD stone was present, status post sphincterotomy and stone retrieval and plastic biliary stent placement. ' Recommended to undergo an MRI and MRCP at the cholecystectomy before repeat ERCP to assess dilatation response to sphincterotomy. 'Follow up with referring physician to return and two months for ERCP post cholecystectomy.",2598,session,openai,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,False,False,True,False,0,True,False,False,False
