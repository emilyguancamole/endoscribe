I am giving you a transcript from a colonoscopy procedure. The task is to extract procedure entities. Make sure you are accurate (no mistakes), complete (do not miss any relevant information), and organized (record information in a manner that matches clinical standards).

The target entities you must extract are listed below with descriptions or instructions. Follow the instructions. Do not guess.

indications: Reasons for performing the procedure. Include patient history if mentioned, but NOT including when last colonoscopy done.
last_colonoscopy: When last colonoscopy was performed if mentioned, otherwise "N/A".
bbps_simple: Overall Boston Bowel Prep score as [adequate/inadequate].
bbps_right: BBPS in right colon as [number].
bbps_transverse: BBPS in right colon as [number].
bbps_left: BBPS in left colon as [number].
bbps_total: sum of BBPS in right, transverse, and left colons
extent: Furthest location where the colonoscope reached. Terminal ileum is further than cecum.
findings: All findings of the procedure as free text. This must begin with the extent of exam: "The colonoscope was advanced to {extent}." Then, record other findings, including:
- polyps/masses and their location, quantity, type (in parentheses),
- maneuvers performed or attempted,
- biopsies,
- technical challenges,
- state of colon mucosa,
- Findings should end with retroflexion: "Upon retroflexion, {findings by retroflexion}, or "Retroflexion not performed" if not performed or mentioned.
Any other findings not listed above should also be included. Be very thorough and include all important findings. The order of findings generally should follow the order of the transcript. 
Report findings in an organized, concise way.

polyp_count: If no polyps were found, record "0". This must be consistent with the Findings section.
impressions: Summarizes the most important findings, briefly as a list.

Do NOT include bowel prep SCORE in free-text findings. The scores as numbers should ONLY appear in the appropriate bbps fields.

Return the result as a valid JSON object. Do not return any additional comments or explanation.
