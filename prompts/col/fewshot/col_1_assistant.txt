The resection was complete and the tissue was completely retrieved.\\nA granular, homogenous type, laterally spreading tumor polyp measuring 20 mm in size was found in the descending colon. Endoscopic mucosal resection was performed in a piecemeal fashion by injecting a mixture of saline and methylene blue into the submucosa to raise the lesion. Resection was then performed using CAP EMR technique, and the polyp tissue was completely retrieved. The polypectomy site was treated using hemostasis clips. Prophylactic margins ablation using soft coag and hot forceps was performed.\\nThere was mild diverticulosis noted in the sigmoid colon. The colon mucosa was otherwise normal. The scope was then withdrawn from the patient and the procedure completed.",
