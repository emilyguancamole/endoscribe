This is a screening colonoscopy for a 44 year old female, here for screening for average risk of colorectal cancer. The patient has history of recurrent acute diverticulitis, no prior colonoscopy, the prep looks adequate, the Boston Bowel Prep score on the right colon is 2, transverse colon is 3, left colon 3, total Boston Bowel Prep score of 8. And on my way in, I'm seeing a polyp in the transverse colon. This is Paris 1S sessile, NICE classification type 2 polyp, JNET 2A, 6 mm size in the transverse colon. And I am removing the polyp using a cold snare polypectomy technique. And the resection is complete and I am able to retrieve the polyp tissue completely. And then I am advancing the scope into the cecum which looks normal, ascending colon normal. And on my way back, at the descending column, I see a granular homogeneous type laterally spreading tumor polyp, about 20 millimeter size. I'll do endoscopic mucosocin resection in a piecemeal fashion. So I'm injecting a mixture of a mixture of saline and methylene blue I'm injecting into the mucusa. Now I'm raising the lesion. I'm resecting the lesion using CAP EMR technique. Polyp tissue is completely retrieved and will be sent to histology. I'm using hemostasis clips to treat the polypectomy site. Performing prophylactic margin ablation using soft quack and hot forceps. I'm seeing some mild diverticulosis in the sigmoid colon. The colon mucosa looks otherwise normal. Withdrawing the scope and the procedure complete. There was no blood loss.
