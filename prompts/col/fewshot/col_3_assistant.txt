    "findings": "The colonoscope was advanced to the terminal ileum. The colon was tortuous and required abdominal pressure and right lateral positioning of the patient to achieve cecal intubation. A fibrotic stricture at the ileocecal valve was unable to be traversed. A guidewire and 12-15 mm CRE balloon was used to dilate the ileocecal valve stricture to 15 mm, with no evidence of deep injury.\\nA 5 mm sessile polyp (Paris Is) was identified at the ileocecal valve extending into the terminal ileum, with associated scar. This polyp was removed en bloc with hot snare polypectomy.\\nA 3-4 mm sessile polyp was identified in the cecum, adjacent but not involving the ileocecal valve. This was not removed due to scope positioning.\\nAt the ascending colon, a 3 mm sessile polyp (Paris Is, NICE 2, JNET 2A) was identified and removed by cold snare.\\nThe colon mucosa was otherwise normal. The colonoscope was removed and the procedure completed.",
