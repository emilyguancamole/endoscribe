Extract polyp details from the following transcript and findings. There are 2 polyps, so there should be 2 JSON objects in the array.

Transcript:
This is a screening colonoscopy for a 44 year old female, here for screening for average risk of colorectal cancer. The patient has history of recurrent acute diverticulitis, no prior colonoscopy, the prep looks adequate, the Boston Bowel Prep score on the right colon is 2, transverse colon is 3, left colon 3, total Boston Bowel Prep score of 8. And on my way in, I'm seeing a polyp in the transverse colon. This is Paris 1S sessile, NICE classification type 2 polyp, JNET 2A, 6 mm size in the transverse colon. And I am removing the polyp using a cold snare polypectomy technique. And the resection is complete and I am able to retrieve the polyp tissue completely. And then I am advancing the scope into the cecum which looks normal, ascending colon normal. And on my way back, descending colon looks normal. And there is some mild diverticulosis in the sigmoid colon, otherwise the colon mucosa looks unremarkable. Retroflexion no abnormalities. The rest of the exam was normal. The scope is withdrawn and the procedure complete. There was no blood loss. End of procedure 18.

Findings:
"A 6 mm sessile polyp (Paris Is, NICE 2, JNET 2A) was found in the transverse colon. Polypectomy was performed with a cold snare. The resection was complete and the tissue was completely retrieved.\\nA granular, homogenous type, laterally spreading tumor polyp measuring 20 mm in size was found in the descending colon. Endoscopic mucosal resection was performed in a piecemeal fashion by injecting a mixture of saline and methylene blue into the submucosa to raise the lesion. Resection was then performed using CAP EMR technique, and the polyp tissue was completely retrieved. The polypectomy site was treated using hemostasis clips. Prophylactic margins ablation using soft coag and hot forceps was performed.\\nThere was mild diverticulosis noted in the sigmoid colon. The colon mucosa was otherwise normal. The scope was then withdrawn from the patient and the procedure completed."
