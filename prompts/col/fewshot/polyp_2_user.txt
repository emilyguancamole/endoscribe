Transcript:
This is a diagnostic colonoscopy, we have an 80 year old female here for colonoscopy for evaluation of unintentional weight loss, history of malignant neoplasm cancer at recto sigmoid junction that was resected. The last colonoscopy was 5 years ago and was normal, today the Boston the ball prep overall was adequate, the Boston ball prep score on the right colon is 1. And the colon was severely tortuous with suboptimal prep in some segments along with severe diverticulosis. Transverse colon ball prep is 2 left colon is 2, total Boston broad drop score is 5, adequate for a diagnostic and there was severe diverticulosis in the sigmoid colon, descending colon, transverse colon and ascending colon. I am able to reach the cecum and I do not see any large lesion but given the suboptimal prep there could be small lesions that could be missed and otherwise no large lesion throughout the colon. Red reflection revealed grade 2 hemorrhoids. I am taking the colonoscope out and completing the procedure and end of procedure.

Findings: 
"The colon was severely tortuous with suboptimal prep in some segments. Examination revealed severe diverticulosis in the sigmoid, transverse and ascending colon. No large lesions observed throughout the colon, but small lesions could be missed due to suboptimal prep.\\nRetroflexed views revealed Grade 2 hemorrhoids."
