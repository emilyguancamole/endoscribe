Extract polyp details from the following transcript and findings. There are 3 polyps, so there should be 3 JSON objects in the array.

Hello we're here with a 55-year-old male. I'm now inserting the scope. Scopus in. I'm now advancing up the rectum. I'm now in the sigmoid colon. I'm now in the transverse core. The Boston Ball Prep store here is 2 the qualities the prep quality seems to be almost adequate. I'm now advancing to the transverse colon. The BBBS here is 2 as well. I'm now moving up to transverse colon and I'm now a right colon. The basketball prep score here is 2 which brings our overall bowel prep score to 6. I am now advancing to the cecum. I am able to identify the appendix and the ileocecal valve. So far the colon was a bit torturous and it required some amount of abdominal pressure, right lateral position to get the scope all the way here to the cecum. There seems to be a fibrodic stricture at ileocecal valve and I'm not able to get past it. Now inserting a guide wire and a 12 to 15 millimeter CRE balloon at the ileacecal valve to open to open up the structure. I'm dilating it and I've dilated it to 15 millimeters. There seems to be no evidence of any injury, any deep injury. There seems to be a polyp for the ileocecal valve and it seems to be extending into the terminal ileum. It is a sessile polyp that's 5 millimeters in size and Paris 1S class. There seems to be a scar as well. I'm beginning resection of the polypip using hot snare. I'm resecting the polyp en block. Polypectomy is now complete. I'm now beginning withdrawal at the scope and I'm able to see a 3 maybe 4 millimeter polypip in the cecum but it does not involve the ileocecal valve. I'm beginning polypectomy for this polyp as well. Commencing polypectomy. I'm having trouble getting the scope into the right spot. Hmm still having difficulty. I don't think there is a need to resect immediately, so I'm not proceeding going to leave it. So I'm now withdrawing the scope. at the ascending colon I am able to see another cecila polyp that's about 3 millimeters in size and I'm using colesner to resect it. This polyp has A classification paris 1S, NICE 2, Gena 2A. Further on, I'm not able to see more mucosal abnormalities masses or polyps of any kind. The domain of the colon appears to be normal. I am now removing the scope and the scope is out.

Findings:
"The colonoscope was advanced to the cecum, which was identified by the ileocecal valve and the appendiceal orifice. The colon was tortuous and required abdominal pressure and right lateral positioning of the patient to achieve cecal intubation. A fibrotic stricture at the ileocecal valve was unable to be traversed. A guidewire and 12-15 mm CRE balloon was used to dilate the ileocecal valve stricture to 15 mm, with no evidence of deep injury.\\nA 5 mm sessile polyp (Paris Is) was identified at the ileocecal valve extending into the terminal ileum, with associated scar. This polyp was removed en bloc with hot snare polypectomy.\\nA 3-4 mm sessile polyp was identified in the cecum, adjacent but not involving the ileocecal valve. This was not removed due to scope positioning.\\nAt the ascending colon, a 3 mm sessile polyp (Paris Is, NICE 2, JNET 2A) was identified and removed by cold snare.\\nThe colon mucosa was otherwise normal. The colonoscope was removed and the procedure completed.",
