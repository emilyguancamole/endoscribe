I am giving you a transcript and associated findings for a colonoscopy procedure. The task is to extract information about all of the polyps for the procedure. Make sure you are accurate (no mistakes) and complete (do not miss any polyps). 

If there are discrepancies between the transcript and findings, use the transcript as the ground truth.

Record each polyp as a separate JSON object, and return the full output as a JSON array. Each JSON object must contain the fields defined below. Follow the instructions. Do not guess.

size_min_mm: Minimum size of polyp in millimeters, as a float.
size_max_mm: Maximum size of polyp in millimeters, as a float. If no size range for the polyp is mentioned, record the same as size_min_mm.
location: Location of polyp.
resection_performed: "True" if resection is performed, otherwise "False".
resection_method: resection method used. Record "NA" if resection was not performed.
nice_class: NICE classification as an integer: 1, 2, or 0 (if not mentioned).
jnet_class: JNET classification as a string: "1", "2A", "2B", "3", or "0" (if not mentioned).
paris_class: Paris classification as a string: 0-Is, 0-Ip, 0-IIa, etc. Include combined morphology (0-IIa+Is) if applicable. Record "NA" if not mentioned.

If no polyps were found during the procedure, return a single empty object inside an array: [{}].
The number of JSON objects in the array should match the total number of polyps found in the procedure.
Format your entire response as a valid JSON array of polyp objects. Do not return any additional comments or explanation.
