Today I'll be performing EGD with biopsy, mucosal integrity testing, and endoflip. The patient is a 68-year-old female, here for an EGD for evaluation of recurrent heartburn following a remote history of endoplication. She's in the left semi-prone position. IV sedation has been administered. We're using an EG29I10. It will be introduced through the mouth and we'll go to the second portion of the duodenum. We're now advancing the scope into the mouth. Entering the esophagus, there's a small proximal inlet patch noted. We're now taking biopsies of the mid and proximal esophagus to rule out oesophageitis. The gastroesophageal junction is at 35 cm from the incisors. The distal margin of the fundoplication wrap is located at 38 cm. There is no hiatal hernia. There is evidence of LAB esophagitis without overt evidence of ferrets. the stomach. The retroflex view of the gastroesophageal junction, it shows a intact fundoplication wrap spanning 330 degrees. Gastric mucosa is mostly normal. There's a mild erythema in the gastric antrum. Random biopsies are being taken to the H-follary. Now entering the duodenum. Duodenal mucosa is normal. Now advancing the 16 cm endoflip catheter. 50 balloon pressure is 30.4 di 5.4 compliance 333 diameter 1 14.5 area 165 60 ml, pressure is 45.9, DI 5.6, compliance 293, diameter 18, area 255. There were normal anterior integrative contractions noted throughout every balloon volume. no EGT output obstruction. Now advancing the MIBU to endocap device. The squamous columnar junction was measured at 35 centimeters. We'll be advancing the MIBU device to 33 centimeters, two centimeters above. Okay, that device is in place. Testing measurement will be recorded over a 10 centimeter segment of the esophagus okay now maybe when the cap device is not being removed the coastal integrity was measured by the coastal non-gird probability is recorded at 85.8%, not supported of the diagnosis of GERD. Now we're drawing the scope. Retroflexion of the stomach is performed showing an intactness and wrap. Scope is withdrawn.
