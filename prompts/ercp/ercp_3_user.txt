We're doing an ERCP with sphincterotomy and spike glass clangioscopy and stone removal on a 68-year-old female person for evaluation therapy for bile duct still. The patient has a past medical history of GERD, has epigraphic abdominal pain that was treated with antispasmodics and she has symptoms of dysphagia.
IV sedation is now being administered. I am commencing the procedure. I am advancing the Pentex ED3490K duodenoscope to the mouth and passing it into the east phase which appears normal, though limited views. I'm advancing into the stomach now, also appears to be normal and limited use. I'm directing the scope into the second portion of the duodenum. 
Prior scout film of the abdomen has been performed. The duodenoscope is advanced into the major papilla without detailed examination of the upper geoid tract. 
The major papilla appears normal but has a long infinitum requiring a long scope position. 
I'm proceeding with biliary cannulation. I'm attempting to cannulate the CBD with a sphincterotome I preloaded with a hydrojag wire. The pancreatic duct is, I've unintentionally cannulated the pancreatic duct. 
Placing a 5 French and 3 centimeter pancreatic duct stent for pancreatitis profile axis. I'm now using a double guide wire technique to successfully cannulate the bile duct. Contrast injection under fluoroscopic guidance shows a mildly dilated CBD, a filling defect confirming the presence of a CBD calculus, a torture of CBD but no evidence of stricturing, non-dilated intrahepatic ducts. I am now performing a 4mm biliary sphincterotomy using ERBE electrocautery with no bleeding that can be observed. To facilitate the stone removal, I'm performing an 8mm balloon sphincteroplasty. I'm then using a 12mm stone retrieval balloon to perform multiple balloon sweeps, successfully removing the stone. Now advancing the spikeless digital cholangioscope, I'm examining the common bile duct, the common hepatic duct, and branches next to the hilum. I can't find any abnormalities, mast lesions, or strictures in the bile ducts. I'm taking biopsies from the distal CBD for further evaluation. Injecting contrast to confirm filling defects. The final contrast injection confirms that there are no remaining filling defects. I'm now withdrawing the spikeless cholangioscope and diadenoscope. The estimated blood loss is minimal. The patient appears to be stable. There appears to be no complications
