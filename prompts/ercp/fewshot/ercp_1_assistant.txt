    "indications": "58 year old male here for an ERCP for the follow up of bile duct stones. Patient underwent an ERCP with stent placement in 02/2019, followed by recent cholecystectomy.",
    "samples_taken": "False",
    "egd_findings": "EGD not performed.\\n\\nESOPHAGUS: No abnormalities on limited views.\\n\\nSTOMACH: No abnormalities on limited views.\\n\\nDUODENUM: Limited views of the first and second part of the duodenum showed no abnormalities.",
    "ercp_findings": "A scout film confirmed presence of a previously placed stent in the CBD. Stent had partially migrated inside the CBD. The pancreatic stent was not seen on fluoroscopy or at the ampulla. The old stent was removed using a rat tooth forceps.\\n\\nA sphincterotome with a 0.025 inch wire was used to cannulate the CBD. Cannulation was somewhat difficult given the known periampullary diverticulum. The pancreas was not cannulated. The wire was advanced into the left intrahepatic duct and exchanged. A 9-12 mm balloon was advanced and balloon trawl yielded sludge. A balloon occlusion cholangiogram showed a non-dilated CBD with no evidence of a leak, stones or filling defects. The cystic duct opacified and had a low insertion. Bile duct drainage was excellent.\\n\\nThe scope was then completely withdrawn from the patient and the procedure completed.",
