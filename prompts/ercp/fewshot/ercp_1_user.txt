Extract procedure entities from the following transcript:

I'm performing an ERCP on a 58-year-old male who's here for follow-up of bile duct stones and removal of a previously placed biliary stent. The patient underwent an ERCP with stent placement in February 2019, followed by a recent cholecystectomy. He now presents for stent removal and evaluation of any residual stones. Timeout has been performed and IV sedation has been administered and I'm now commencing the procedure. I'm now advancing the Dupontax ED3490TK duodenoscope to the mouth. I'm in the esophagus, which appears to be normal. I'm advancing it further into the stomach, performing a retroflex view. And I can confirm that the cardia and the fundus appears normal. I'm continuing to the antrum through to the first portion and the second portion of the duodenum, which are both unremarkable. The scout film confirmed the presence of a previously placed biliary stent. It looks partially migrated within the common bile duct. There is no pancreatic stent visible in fluoroscopy or the ampulla. Using rat tooth forceps, I'm now removing the old stent. The stent was removed without difficulty. I am now attempting biliary duct cannulation using a sphincterome preloaded with a 0.025 inch guide wire. Cannulation is proving to be somewhat difficult due to the presence of a known periampillary diverticulum. I've made multiple attempts to cannulate now and after several attempts I'm able to successfully advance the guidewire into the left intrahepatic duct. and I'm exchanging it for a more stable position. A 9-12 mm extraction balloon is what I'm now advancing and I'm performing multiple balloon sweeps of the bile duct. The sweeps are yielding sludge but no stones and occlusion cholangiogram is now being performed. The cholangiogram revealed a non-dilated CBD with no evidence of bile leak. The cystic duct is opacified and noted to have low insertion. I can see that the bile flow is excellent with good contrast drainage. At this point I am withdrawing the scope completely. The scope is out and this is the end of procedure.
