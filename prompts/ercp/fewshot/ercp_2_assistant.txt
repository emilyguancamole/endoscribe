    "indications": "50 year old female here for an Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for evaluation of LET elevation. She has a history of bipolar disorder, possible COPD, multiple spinal surgeries on chronic opioids for abdominal pain, abdominal surgeries, s/p lap cholecystectomy on 7/19/2020 at OSH for emphysematous acalculous cholecystitis, lap cholecystectomy was complicated by bile leak, biliary obstruction. IR PBD on 7/24 but accidentally dislodged after.",
    "egd_findings": "EGD not performed.\\n\\nESOPHAGUS: The esophagus was normal on limited views.\\n\\nSTOMACH: Solid food debris was seen on limited views.",
    "ercp_findings": "A scout film of the abdomen was performed. Surgical drain noted. The duodenoscope was advanced to the major papilla without detailed examination of the upper GI tract. The major papilla was normal.\\n\\nThe bile duct was deeply cannulated with the sphincterotome preloaded with a 0.035 Hydra Jagwire. Contrast was injected. Cholangiogram was performed with mildly dilated CBD. There was an abrupt cut off of the CBD at proximal-middle level with no contrast upstream.\\n\\nA 6 mm biliary sphincterotomy was performed using Erbe electrocautery. There was no bleeding following sphincterotomy.\\n\\nThe Spyglass digital cholangioscope was loaded into the duodenoscope channel. The common bile duct and common hepatic duct were normal. There was no intraluminal mass lesion at the level of CBD cut off. The area was probed with a Visiglide 0.025 inch wire, but the wire could not be advanced further. Contrast was injected but no contrast flow upstream. The scope was then completely withdrawn from the patient and the procedure completed.",
    "impressions":[
        "Normal major papilla",
        "CBD cannulated with sphincterotome and guidewire",
        "Cholangiogram with focal tight stricture; cut off in mid-proximal CBD",
        "Biliary sphincterotomy was performed",
        "Spyglass cholangioscopy revealed normal distal bile duct; no intraluminal growth at the cut off site. Guidewire could not be advanced further."
