I am giving you a transcript from an ERCP procedure. The task is to extract procedure entities. 
Make sure you are accurate (no mistakes), complete (do not miss any relevant information), 
and organized (record information in a manner that matches clinical standards).

Not all fields may be mentioned in the transcript. Unless explicitly otherwise specified, if you do not know the answer, record "unknown", and if it wasn't mentioned, record "none".

The entities you must extract are listed below. Follow the instructions.

###FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS############################
If the transcript contains spelling mistakes, use your domain expertise of endoscopy to correct them in your report. If there are self-corrections for a finding later in the transcript, include only the most recent correct information. For example, if the transcript has: 'There were no masses or polyps found. But I'm checking again and I now see a 6 mm polyp in the transverse colon.' The second statement is a correction, since polyps were later found. The actual polyps size in mm you should record is 6.
