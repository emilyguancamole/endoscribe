This is an upper endoscopic ultrasound with fine needle biopsy performed on a 63-year-old female with date of birth of August 20, 1981, presenting for an EOS for the evaluation of pancreatic head mass and a dilated pancreatic duct. She has undergone two prior EOS procedures with FNA performed by an outside provider, both of which resulted in a non-diagnostic cytology. We are now commencing the procedure. I'm introducing the endoscope through the mouth and advancing under direct visualization. I'm now in the esophagus. As I pass the scope through the esophagus, I can see that the mucus here appears to be normal. There's no strictures, nodularity, or erosions that I can see. I'm advancing the scope into the stomach now. And it appears to be normal here with no ulcers, erosions, or mass lesions. Continue to advance the scope into the first part of the diadenome. And now I'm in the second part of the diadenome. So far, the mucosa has appeared to be normal. There seems to be no erythema, with less blunting or alterations of any kind. I'm pushing the endoscope here, the second portion of the diurnum, to systematically evaluate the pancreas and the surrounding structures. I'm beginning to evaluate the pancreas at the head and tracing it to the tail. There's a partially circumscribed, circum... Yeah, so there's a 0.8x1.6 cm partially circumscribed isoechoic mass with papillary projections that can be seen at the ampulla and is obstructing the pancreatic duct. Upstream to the pancreatic duct dilation is noted and measures 10 millimeters, tapering to 4.4 millimeters in the body. The duct is not visualized in the tail. There is a small 3x 4 mm cyst communicating with the pancreatic duct that can be seen in the body. There are no concerning features. An additional intraductal filling defect can be observed in the pancreatic duct within the head, but I am not biopsying this. But I am biopsying the ampullary mass using a 22 gauge short core needle. a fine needle biopsy. I did a prologue of two passes. There's an on-site technologist who's confirmed adequate cellularity. The findings are suspicious for a main duct introductral papillary mucinous neoplasm, an IPMN. I'm visualizing the biliary tree. The common bile duct is of normal caliber measuring between 4.1 millimeters and 4.6 millimeters at the ampulla. There's no involvement of the bile duct by the intraductal pancreatic mass. The liver showed no suspicious lesions or abnormalities. I'm beginning withdrawal of the scope and I'm re-evaluating the visualized structures on withdrawal. On my way back I can see that there are no other abnormalities other than the ones that I've previously mentioned. There seems to be no evidence of bleeding. I'm now withdrawing the scope. The scope is out. The patient appears to be stable. There seems to be no immediate complications. The estimated blood loss is minimal and this is the end of procedure.
