Right, the procedure is being done at the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center and today is the 2nd of January, 2025. The patient is a 60-year-old female who is undergoing pancreatic cancer surveillance due to a strong family history of pancreatic cancer. She's participating in the ongoing CAPS research study. So I'm using an Olympus GF-UCT180 echo endoscope today. We're now beginning the procedure and I'm now introducing the scope through the mouth into the esophagus. As I pass the scope through the esophagus, the mucosa appears to be normal and there seems to be no erosion, stricture, or some masses. Now on the stomach, there seems to be a moderate amount of retained thick liquid with particulate material that's seen. This is despite overnight fasting. The gastric mucosa otherwise appears to be normal and there seems to be no ulcers, nautilarities or visible lesions. I'm continuing to advance into the duodenum. I'm now in the first part, advancing to the second portion of the duodenum. The mucosa appears normal here. There seems to be no erythema, villus, blunting or matched lesions. I'm now visualizing the pancreas. I'm beginning at the head and tracing it to tail. The pancreas exhibits a diffuse hyper-echoic focal end strands but there seems to be no discrete masses. There seems to be diffuse lobularity throughout the pancreas but it doesn't really meet the criteria for chronic pancreatitis. The tail appears fatty with a consistent focal fat infiltration. The main pancreatic duct is normal in caliber with no echogenic duct wall thickening, there's no stricture stones or mural nodules. I'm visualizing the biliary tree and the common bile duct appears to be normal, there's no dilation stones or wall thickening and measures about 4.5 millimeters and appears to be normal. The liver, I'm visualizing the liver and appears to be normal as well, there's no focal lesions or any suspicious findings. There's no peripancreatic, perigastric or celiac axis lymph nodes that can be visualized. As part of the CAPS study protocol, I'm I'm collecting diurnal secretions adjacent to the normal appearing major papilla. That is the end and I'm now withdrawing the scope and re-polluting the structures on my way back. They all appear normal. I feel no bleeding or immediate complications. The scope is out. The patient appears to be stable. There seems to be very minimal blood loss.
