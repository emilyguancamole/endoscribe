eplbd_adverse_events: Describe any bleeding, perforation, or other complications in a sentence
mech_lithotripsy_performed: true/false if performed
mech_lithotripsy_indication: All reasons mechanical lithotripsy was performed, e.g. large stone, impacted stone, failed balloon
mech_lithotripsy_basket_system: Type of basket system used, e.g. 'mechanical lithrtripter basket'
lithotripsy_location: Location of stone where lithotripsy was performed, e.g. distal CBD, hilum
mech_lithotripsy_stone: Characteristics of stone, e.g. hard/calcified, soft, faceted
mech_lithotripsy_outcome: Outcome of lithotripsy, e.g. 'Complete fragmentation achieved'
mech_lithotripsy_basket_impaction: If basket impaction occured, describe impaction type, the rescue performe, and the outcome of rescue in sentences
mech_lithotripsy_adverse_events: Describe any adverse events from mechanical lithotripsy in a sentence
chol_lithotripsy_performed: true/false if chololangioscopy-guided lithotripsy performed
chol_lithotripsy_platform: Cholangioscopy platform used, e.g. 'SpyGlass DS II'
chol_lithotripsy_modality: Lithotripsy modality used, e.g. 'EHL', 'laser'
chol_lithotripsy_target_stones: Describe target stones of chololangioscopy-guided lithotripsy, including number, location, size
chol_lithotripsy_irrigation: true/false if saline irrigation used
chol_lithotripsy_fragmentation: Outcome of fragmentation, e.g. 'complete', 'partial', 'unsuccessful'
chol_lithotripsy_debris_clearance: Methods used for debris clearance after lithotripsy, e.g. 'balloon sweeps'
chol_lithotripsy_details: Describe any additional details about settings or shot counts
stone_therapy_limitations: Any limitations during stone therapy, e.g. 'poor visualization due to bile/pus/blood'
duct_clearance_status: Final assessment of duct clearance after stone therapy as 'complete', 'near-complete', 'partial', 'failed'
duct_clearance_narrative: Describe the findings and management based on the final duct clearance status in sentences, e.g. 'All visible stones and sludge were removed.', 'Small non-obstructing stone remains, expected to pass', 'Failed clearance due to distal narrowing'
staged_strategy_narrative: If partial/failed clearance, describe in detailed sentences the staged strategy if planned, including indication, stent type/size/position, drainage quality, and plan
stone_therapy_complications: Complications during adjunct stone therapy, e.g. bleeding, perforation, extravasation, cholangitis worsening
stone_therapy_bile_drainage_narrative: Describe how and how well bile and contrast drained after stone therapy, e.g. 'Bile and contrast drained well into the duodenum through the papilla.'
fluoroscopic_img_obtained: true/false if final fluoroscopic image obtained after stone therapy

###FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS############################
If the transcript contains spelling mistakes, use your domain expertise of endoscopy to correct them in your report. If there are self-corrections for a finding later in the transcript, include only the most recent correct information. For example, if the transcript has: 'There were no masses or polyps found. But I'm checking again and I now see a 6 mm polyp in the transverse colon.' The second statement is a correction, since polyps were later found. The actual polyps size in mm you should record is 6.
Return the result as a JSON file. Do not return any additional comments or explanation.
