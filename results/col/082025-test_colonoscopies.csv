115,Llama 4,59 year old male for assessment of multiple colonic polyps around the site of anastomosis.,April 2021,adequate,2,3,3,8,cecum,The colonoscope was advanced to the cecum. Multiple colonic diverticula were observed in the sigmoid colon. At least 9 colonic polyps were observed around the anastomosis area.\nA 10 mm transverse colonic polyp adjacent to the anastomosis was removed by cold EMR in a piecemeal fashion.\nA 5 mm transverse colonic polyp adjacent to the anastomosis was removed by cold snare polypectomy.\nAn 8 mm transverse colonic polyp adjacent to the anastomosis was removed by cold snare polypectomy.\nA 6 mm transverse colonic polyp adjacent to the anastomosis was removed by piecemeal cold EMR.\nA 25 mm transverse colonic polyp was removed by piecemeal hot EMR and edge ablation.\nA 20 mm transverse colonic polyp adjacent to the anastomosis was removed by piecemeal hot EMR and edge ablation.\nA 20 mm transverse colonic polyp adjacent to the anastomosis was removed by piecemeal hot EMR and edge ablation.\nA 12 mm flat polyp across the anastomosis and a 10 mm flat polyp across the anastomosis were removed by hot EMR and edge ablation in a piecemeal fashion.\nThe colon mucosa was otherwise normal. The colonoscope was removed and the procedure completed.,9,"['Multiple colonic polyps around the anastomosis site; all removed.', 'Multiple colonic diverticula observed in the sigmoid colon.', 'No complications reported.']"
95,Llama 4,65 year old male here for assessment.,"October 5, 2024",adequate,3,3,3,9,cecum,"The colonoscope was advanced to the cecum. A 6 mm periappendiceal polyp (Paris Is) was identified and removed en bloc with cold snare polypectomy. The specimen was retrieved for histological examination.\nThe colon mucosa was otherwise normal. Prominent veins were noted along the colon. No other masses, polyps or mucosal abnormalities were observed throughout the colon. The colonoscope was removed and the procedure completed.",1,"['A 6mm periappendiceal polyp (Paris Is) was resected en bloc with cold snare.', 'Prominent veins noted along the colon.', 'Otherwise normal colon mucosa.']"
180,Llama 4,50-year-old male coming for colonoscopy with an average risk for colorectal cancer. History of a tubular adenoma on top of a previous EMR scar.,4/25/24,adequate,2,3,3,8,cecum,"The colonoscope was advanced to the cecum. On withdrawal, a short, less than 5 mm fibrotic stricture from previous EMR was noted in the transverse colon. Two 5 mm polyps were identified arising from a previous EMR scar at 6 o'clock and 10 o'clock positions. The lesions were marked with APC. EMR was attempted with dye injection but showed no lifting sign. The lesions were removed using hot forceps avulsion. The resection site was treated with APC to ablate residual polyp tissue and a prophylactic clip was placed at the 10 o'clock position. The rest of the colon examination was normal.",2,"['Previous EMR scar with 2 new 5mm polyps, resected with hot forceps avulsion.', 'Fibrotic stricture noted in the transverse colon.', 'Prophylactic clip placed at resection site.']"
