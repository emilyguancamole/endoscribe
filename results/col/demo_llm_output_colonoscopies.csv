16,S3_3__outputs,"65-year-old female here for a colonoscopy for personal history of colon polyps","09/2023",adequate,3,3,3,9,cecum,"The colonoscope was advanced to the cecum. The Boston Bowel Prep score was 3 in the right colon, 3 in the transverse colon, and 3 in the left colon, for a total score of 9.\nInitially, five polyps were identified in the cecum, measuring 3-13 mm in size, all Paris 0-Is and NICE type 2. The 13 mm polyp was resected with hot EMR after saline demarcation and lifting. The other polyps were removed with cold snare.\nDuring withdrawal, a 10 mm and a 5 mm polyp were identified in the ascending colon, both Paris 0-Is, NICE 2, and removed with cold snare.\nIn the transverse colon, a 10 mm polyp was identified and resected with cold snare.\nIn the sigmoid colon, two polyps (5 mm and 10 mm) were identified and resected with cold snare. Two tattoos were observed in the sigmoid colon, with no evidence of prior polypectomy scar.\nPancolonic diverticulosis was noted. The colon mucosa was otherwise normal. The colonoscope was removed without complications.",8,"['Multiple polyps identified and resected in the cecum, ascending colon, transverse colon, and sigmoid colon.', 'Pancolonic diverticulosis noted.', 'Two tattoos observed in the sigmoid colon, with no evidence of prior polypectomy scar.']"

Multiple colonic diverticula were observed in the sigmoid colon. At least 9 colonic polyps were identified around the anastomosis site.\nA 10 mm polyp was found in the transverse colon, adjacent to the anastomosis.

Cold snare polypectomy was performed, and polypectomy was complete.\nAn 8 mm polyp was found in the transverse colon, adjacent to the anastomosis. Cold snare polypectomy was performed, and polypectomy was complete.\nA 6 mm polyp was found in the transverse colon, adjacent to the anastomosis. Piecemeal cold EMR was performed, and polypectomy was complete.\nA 25 mm polypoid lesion was found in the transverse colon. Piecemeal hot EMR and edge ablation were performed.\nA 20 mm polyp was found in the transverse colon, adjacent to the anastomosis. Piecemeal hot EMR and edge ablation were performed, and polypectomy was complete. Another 20 mm polyp was found in the transverse colon, adjacent to the anastomosis. Piecemeal hot EMR and edge ablation were performed.\nA 12 mm flat polyp was found across the anastomosis. Hot EMR and edge ablation were performed in a piecemeal fashion, and polypectomy was complete. A 10 mm flat polyp was found across the anastomosis.
