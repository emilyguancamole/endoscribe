16,Saju,adequate,3,3,3,9,cecum,"Five polyps were found in the cecum, measuring from 3 to 13 mm in size, Paris 0-1S, NICE type 2. The 13 mm polyp was resected with hot endoscopic mucosal resection. The other polyps were removed with cold snare. Additional polyps were found in the ascending colon (10 mm and 5 mm, Paris 0-1S, NICE 2), transverse colon (10 mm), and sigmoid colon (5 mm and 10 mm), all of which were resected with cold snare. Pancolonic diverticulosis was observed. Two tattoos were seen in the sigmoid colon. No scars from previous polypectomy were observed.",9,13;10;5;10;10;5;10;3;3,cecum;ascending colon;ascending colon;transverse colon;sigmoid colon;sigmoid colon;cecum;cecum;cecum,True,2;2;2;2;2;2;2;2;2,"['Multiple polyps found and resected throughout the colon.', 'Pancolonic diverticulosis observed.', 'Two tattoos seen in the sigmoid colon.', 'No complications during the procedure.']"
92,Richu,adequate,3,3,3,9,cecum,"The colon was tortuous with a propensity for loop formation. A scar from the previous hepatic flexure EMR was seen, along with a tattoo. Three serrated lesions were found in the transverse colon, measuring 12, 7, and 5 millimeters. The 12 millimeter lesion was resected via cold EMR in a piecemeal fashion. The other two lesions were resected using a cold snare. The remainder of the colon appeared unremarkable. Grade of dysplasia and histology of previous lesions were reported as TSA with high grade dysplasia.",3,12;7;5,transverse colon;transverse colon;transverse colon,True,0;0;0,"['Tortuous colon with propensity for loop formation.', 'Scar from previous hepatic flexure EMR seen with adjacent tattoo.', 'Three serrated lesions found in transverse colon and resected.', 'Remainder of colon appears unremarkable.']"
95,Richu,adequate,3,3,3,9,cecum,"A 6 mm Paris 1S polyp was found in the cecum, peri-appendiceal in location. The polyp was successfully removed using a cold snare polypectomy technique. The rest of the colon, including the ascending, transverse, and descending colon, appeared unremarkable with prominent veins noted. No other masses, polyps, or mucosal abnormalities were observed.",1,6,cecum,True,2,"['A 6 mm Paris 1S polyp was found in the cecum and successfully removed.', 'The rest of the colon appeared unremarkable with prominent veins noted.', 'No other masses, polyps, or mucosal abnormalities were observed.']"
11,Saju,adequate,3,3,3,9,cecum,"A 20 mm laterally spreading lesion (Paris LST-GM 0-2A+1S, JNET 2A) was found in the cecum, inferior to the appendiceal orifice. The lesion was resected in a piecemeal fashion using hot endoscopic mucosal resection. The resection margin was treated with snare soft tip coagulation and the defect was closed with 2 mantis clips. A 5 mm polyp (Paris 0-1S, NICE 2) was found in the sigmoid colon and resected with a cold snare. A 20 mm ulcerated laterally spreading lesion was found in the rectosigmoid colon, 20 cm from the anal verge. The lesion could not be lifted and a biopsy was taken with cold forceps. A tattoo was placed 2 cm distal to the lesion.",3,20;5;20,cecum;sigmoid colon;rectosigmoid colon,true,2;2;0,"['A 20 mm laterally spreading lesion was found in the cecum and resected.', 'A 5 mm polyp was found in the sigmoid colon and resected.', 'A 20 mm ulcerated laterally spreading lesion was found in the rectosigmoid colon and biopsied.']"
180,Pranay,adequate,2,3,3,8,cecum,"A short, less than 5 mm fibrotic stricture from a previous EMR was noted in the transverse colon. Two 5 mm polyps arose from the scar at the 6 o'clock and 10 o'clock positions. The polyps were removed using hot forceps avulsion after attempted EMR with dye injection showed no lifting sign. The resection site was treated with APC to ablate residual polyp tissue and a prophylactic clip was placed at the 10 o'clock position.",2,5;5,transverse colon;transverse colon,true,0;0,"['Fibrotic stricture from previous EMR in the transverse colon.', 'Two 5 mm polyps arose from the scar and were removed using hot forceps avulsion.', 'Resection site treated with APC and prophylactic clip placement.']"
186,Pranay,adequate,2,3,3,8,cecum,"A 20 mm flat polyp (Paris 0-2B, NICE 1, JNET 1) was found in the ascending colon and removed by piecemeal cold EMR. Another 15 mm polyp (Paris 0-2B, NICE 1, JNET 1) was found near the first polyp in the ascending colon and also removed by piecemeal cold EMR. A 15 mm flat polyp (Paris 0-2B, NICE 1, JNET 1) was found in the transverse colon and removed by piecemeal cold EMR. A 2 mm sessile polyp (Paris 1S, NICE 1, JNET 1) was found in the transverse colon and removed using cold snare. A tattoo was found 5 cm distal to the ascending colon polyp.",4,20;15;15;2,ascending colon;ascending colon;transverse colon;transverse colon,true,1;1;1;1,"['Multiple polyps found and removed in the ascending and transverse colon.', 'All polyps were successfully removed by EMR or cold snare.', 'No residual polyp or bleeding was found after resection.', 'Tattoo found 5 cm distal to the ascending colon polyp.']"
