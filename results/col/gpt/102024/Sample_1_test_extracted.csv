12,Saju,adequate,3,3,3,9,cecum,"A flat elevated polyp (Paris 2A, NICE 2, JNET 2A) was found in the cecum. There was evidence of scar from prior biopsy at the lateral margin of the polyp. Submucosal injection was performed to lift the tissue and demarcate the polyp borders. The polyp was removed in piecemeal with a combination of hot EMR and hot avulsion. The resected borders were ablated with hot biopsy forceps on soft coagulation setting. The biopsy was completely retrieved. The resected defect was inspected and no evidence of bleeding or deep injury was found. The defect was closed with two clips. A detailed examination of other parts of the colon was not performed. No complications were noted during the procedure.",1,,cecum,True,False,"['A flat elevated polyp (Paris 2A, NICE 2, JNET 2A) was found in the cecum; removed in piecemeal with hot EMR and hot avulsion.', 'No evidence of bleeding or deep injury at the resected defect.', 'Defect closed with two clips.']"
