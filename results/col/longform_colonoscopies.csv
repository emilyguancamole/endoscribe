The Boston Bowel Prep score was adequate with a total score of 9.\nA 20 mm laterally spreading lesion (Paris 1S, JNET 2A) was identified in the cecum, adjacent to the appendiceal orifice. EMR was performed in a piecemeal fashion with a 10 mm captivator snare and a pre-mixed solution of hetastarch and methylene blue as a lifting agent. The resection was complete, and the margin was treated with snare soft tip coagulation. The defect was closed with two Mantis clips. The specimen was retrieved with a Roth net.\nA 5 mm sessile polyp (Paris 1S, NICE 2) was identified in the sigmoid colon and resected with a cold snare.\nA 20 mm pseudodepressed laterally spreading lesion was identified in the rectosigmoid junction, 20 cm from the anal verge. The lesion did not lift with a pre-mixed solution of hetastarch and methylene blue. A biopsy was taken from the center of the lesion with cold forceps and sent for histology. A tattoo was placed 2 cm distal to the lesion on the opposite wall.\nThe colon mucosa was otherwise normal.
