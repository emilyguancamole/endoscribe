bdstricture01,Llama4,"70-year-old male with a history of metastatic pancreatic cancer, recently diagnosed during AAA evaluation, with a mass in the head of the pancreas, peripancreatic and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, and lung nodules, currently undergoing chemotherapy as part of a clinical trial. The patient had a plastic biliary stent placed at an outside hospital and now presents with abnormal liver function tests and progressive intrahepatic duct dilation.",EGD not performed.\n\nESOPHAGUS: Normal on limited views.\n\nSTOMACH: Normal on limited views.,"A scout film of the abdomen revealed a plastic biliary stent in situ. The duodenoscope advanced smoothly to the major papilla. An occluded plastic biliary stent was identified and removed using a snare. Deep biliary cannulation was successfully achieved using a sphincterotome preloaded with a 0.035 inch guide wire. Contrast injection under fluoroscopic guidance showed a 3 cm biliary stricture in the distal part with upstream common bile duct dilation up to 14 mm and mild diffuse intrahepatic ductal dilation. A 10 mm biliary sphincterotomy was performed using ERBE electrocautery without bleeding. A 10-60 mm uncovered self-expandable metal stent was deployed across the distal biliary stricture, allowing for drainage of contrast and dark bile.","['Occluded plastic biliary stent removed', '3 cm distal biliary stricture with upstream CBD dilation', 'Mild diffuse intrahepatic ductal dilation', '10 mm biliary sphincterotomy performed', '10-60 mm uncovered self-expandable metal stent deployed across the distal biliary stricture']"
bdstone01,,"30 year old male here for an ERCP for the treatment of gallstone pancreatitis. The patient has elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin. He recently had a hospital admission for COVID-19 and acute pancreatitis. CD scan and MR-MRCP show distal common bile duct stone with associated intrahepatic, intra and extra hepatic biliary ductal dilation.",EGD not performed.\n\nESOPHAGUS: The esophagus was normal on limited views.\n\nSTOMACH: The stomach was normal on limited views.\n\nDUODENUM: The second portion of the duodenum was normal on limited views.,"A scout film of the abdomen was performed and appeared normal. The major papilla was normal.\n\nThe bile duct was cannulated with ease using a sphincterotome and guide wire. Cholangiogram showed a normal biliary tree with no evidence of stones or filling defects. The CBD, CHD, and intrahepatic ducts were normal.\n\nA biliary sphincterotomy was performed. A stone extraction balloon was used to attempt stone extraction. The balloon was dilated to 8.5mm and 11.5mm. Multiple sweeps of the bile duct were performed and sludge was removed. The papilla was dilated with a CRE balloon to 6, 7, and 8mm. A balloon occlusion cholangiogram was normal. A 7Fr x 5cm Cook Z stent was placed.","['Normal major papilla', 'Successful biliary cannulation and sphincterotomy', 'Sludge removed from bile duct with balloon sweeps', 'Biliary plastic stent placed', 'No complications or bleeding']"
