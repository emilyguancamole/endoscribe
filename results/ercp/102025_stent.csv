bdstricture01,openai,"70 year old male presenting for management of malignant distal biliary stricture. History of metastatic pancreatic cancer discovered during routine AAA evaluation. Mass located in the head of the pancreas associated with peripancreatic and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy with lung nodules. Currently undergoing chemotherapy as part of a clinical trial. Previous placement of plastic biliary stent at outside hospital, now presenting with abnormal liver function test and progressive intrahepatic duct dilation.",False,EGD not performed.\n\nESOPHAGUS: The esophagus was normal on limited views.\n\nSTOMACH: The stomach was normal on limited views.,"A scout film of the abdomen revealed a plastic biliary stent in situ. The duodenoscope was advanced to the major papilla without detailed examination of the upper GI tract. The occluded plastic biliary stent was identified and removed using a snare.\n\nThe bile duct was deeply cannulated with the sphincterotome preloaded with a 0.035 guidewire. Contrast was injected under fluoroscopic guidance. Cholangiogram showed a 30 mm biliary stricture in the distal part with upstream common bile duct dilation up to 14 mm and mild diffuse intrahepatic ductal dilation.\n\nA 10 mm biliary sphincterotomy was performed using Erbe electrocautery. There was no bleeding following sphincterotomy.\n\nA 10-60 mm uncovered self-expandable metal stent was deployed across the distal biliary stricture. The stent was in a good position at the end of the procedure, allowing for drainage of contrast and dark bile. The scope was then completely withdrawn from the patient and the procedure completed.",FCSEMS malignant,False,"['Normal esophagus and stomach on limited views', 'Occluded plastic biliary stent removed', 'Successful deep biliary cannulation', '30 mm distal biliary stricture with upstream CBD dilation up to 14 mm', 'Mild diffuse intrahepatic ductal dilation', '10 mm biliary sphincterotomy performed', 'Deployment of 10-60 mm uncovered self-expandable metal stent across distal biliary stricture']"
spyglass06,openai,"75-year-old male presenting for therapy of a bile duct stricture. Initially developed jaundice, pruritus, fever, and pain. Evaluated at an outside hospital with elevated liver enzymes. MR-IMRCP showed dilated intrahepatic ducts and CBD stricture. Liver tumor board at Johns Hopkins Hospital described it as a tight stricture in proximal CBD without discrete mass. Oncology workup was negative for malignancy.",True,EGD not performed.\n\nESOPHAGUS: Normal on limited views.\n\nSTOMACH: Normal on limited views.,"Scout film showed previously placed plastic stents traversing the hilum. Duodenoscope advanced to major papilla without detailed examination of upper GI tract. Previously placed plastic stents removed using rat tooth forceps. Major papilla showed evidence of prior sphincterotomy. Biliary cannulation achieved using sphincterotome preloaded with Visiglide wire. Contrast injection under fluoroscopic guidance showed long tight stricture in proximal CBD involving hilum and extending to right and left intrahepatic ducts. Mild intrahepatic ductal dilation noted. Spyglass digital cholangioscope used to examine common bile duct, common hepatic duct, right and left intrahepatic ducts. Right intrahepatic duct not examined due to extensive strictures. Distal CBD appeared normal. Hilum and proximal CBD showed nodular appearance alongside narrowing and dilated tortuous vessels. Multiple SpyBite biopsies taken from this area. Serial balloon dilation of stricture performed using 4mm hurricane balloon to facilitate stent placement. 7 French 12cm plastic bile duct stent placed into right intrahepatic duct and 7 French 15cm plastic bile duct stent placed into left intrahepatic duct. Third stent could not be placed due to limited space. Final cholangiogram confirmed good positioning of stents.",plastic biliary 7F,False,"['Normal esophagus and stomach on limited views', 'Previously placed plastic stents removed', 'Long tight stricture in proximal CBD involving hilum and extending to right and left intrahepatic ducts', 'Mild intrahepatic ductal dilation', 'Nodular appearance and narrowing in hilum and proximal CBD with dilated tortuous vessels', 'Multiple SpyBite biopsies taken from hilum and proximal CBD', 'Serial balloon dilation of stricture performed', 'Placement of 7 French 12cm plastic bile duct stent into right intrahepatic duct and 7 French 15cm plastic bile duct stent into left intrahepatic duct']"
