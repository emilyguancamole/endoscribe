bdstricture01,1_outputs,"The esophagus and stomach were normal on limited views. The duodenum was also visualized, but only the second portion was examined, and it was unremarkable.","A scout film showed a plastic biliary stent in situ, which was occluded and removed using a snare. Deep biliary cannulation was achieved using a sphincterotome preloaded with a 0.035 inch guide wire. Contrast injection under fluoroscopy showed a 30 mm biliary stricture in the distal part with upstream common bile duct dilation up to 14 mm and mild diffuse intrahepatic ductal dilation. A 10 mm biliary sphincterotomy was performed, and a 10x60 mm uncovered self-expandable metal stent was deployed across the distal biliary stricture, allowing for drainage of contrast and dark bile.","['Occluded plastic biliary stent was removed', 'Deep biliary cannulation was successfully achieved', 'A 30 mm biliary stricture was identified in the distal part with upstream CBD dilation and intrahepatic ductal dilation', 'A 10 mm biliary sphincterotomy was performed, and a 10x60 mm uncovered self-expandable metal stent was deployed', 'Limited views of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum were normal']"
spyglass01,1_outputs,"The esophagus and stomach appeared normal. The duodenum was also visualized, with a focus on the major papilla.","A previously placed bile duct stent was removed using rat tooth forceps. Biliary cannulation was performed using a sphincterome preloaded with a 0.025 inch guide wire. A cholangiogram revealed a 20 mm calculus in the distal bile duct, which appeared to have been partially fragmented due to the stent placement. Electrohydraulic lithotripsy was performed under normal saline irrigation, successfully fragmenting the stone. A 10mm balloon sphincteroplasty was performed to facilitate stone removal, followed by several sweeps with a 12-15mm stone retrieval balloon to remove the stone debris. An occlusion cholangiogram confirmed that the bile duct was clear, with no remaining stones or filling defects.","['Successful removal of previously placed bile duct stent', 'Biliary cannulation and visualization of a 20 mm calculus in the distal bile duct', 'Electrohydraulic lithotripsy and balloon sphincteroplasty successfully fragmented and removed the stone', 'Normal esophagus, stomach, and duodenum', 'No immediate complications observed']"
pdstone02,1_outputs,The esophagus and stomach appeared normal.,"A scout film of the abdomen was normal. The main pancreatic duct was successfully cannulated using a sphincterotome with a 0.025 inch Visiglide 1 guide wire. A pancreatogram showed a tortuous and dilated main pancreatic duct with large filling defects in the head, suggesting a large stone. The guide wire could not be advanced past the obstructing stone, but contrast was seen in the body and tail of the pancreas, indicating partial obstruction. A pancreatic sphincterotomy was performed using a 30mm cutting wire and blended electro-surgical current, with self-limited bleeding that stopped spontaneously. Spyglass DS digital pancreatoscopy was used to visualize the main pancreatic duct, confirming a large obstructing stone in the pancreatic head. Electrohydraulic lithotripsy (EHL) was used to fragment the stone, with small fragments seen draining from the pancreatic orifice.","['Successful cannulation of the main pancreatic duct', 'Large stone in the head of the pancreas causing partial obstruction', 'Pancreatic sphincterotomy performed with self-limited bleeding', 'EHL used to fragment the stone, with small fragments draining from the pancreatic orifice', 'Normal esophagus and stomach', 'Procedure terminated due to carbon dioxide retention and prolonged procedure time']"
bdstone02,1_outputs,"The esophagus, stomach, and duodenum were normal in appearance.","A scout film was normal. The major papilla was normal in appearance with bile visibly draining from it. Initial attempts at biliary cannulation were unsuccessful, with cannulation of the pancreatic duct occurring first. A 5-fr, 3-cm Boston Scientific pancreatic plastic stent was placed for post-ERCP pancreatitis prophylaxis. After pre-cut sphincterotomy and needle knife papillotomy, deep cannulation of the bile duct was achieved. A cholangiogram revealed a stone in the distal common bile duct, with normal common bile duct, common hepatic duct, and no dilation of the intrahepatic ducts. The stone was removed using a stone extraction balloon. A 7-fr, 4-cm Cook Zimmon double pigtail biliary plastic stent was placed in the bile duct.","['Normal esophagus, stomach, and duodenum', 'Pancreatic duct cannulation occurred prior to biliary duct cannulation', 'A 5-fr, 3-cm pancreatic stent was placed for post-ERCP pancreatitis prophylaxis', 'Pre-cut sphincterotomy and needle knife papillotomy allowed for deep biliary cannulation', 'A single stone was removed from the distal common bile duct', 'A 7-fr, 4-cm biliary stent was placed in the common bile duct']"
