bdstricture02,2__outputs,"The esophagus was normal on limited views. The stomach, specifically the gastric pouch, was unremarkable. The gastro-jejunostomy anastomosis was patent.","A scout film of the abdomen was performed. The duodenoscope was advanced to the hepaticojejunostomy (H-J) orifice in the jejunum. The previously placed fully covered self-expandable metal stent had migrated. The intrahepatic ducts were deeply cannulated using a sphincterotome preloaded with a Visiglide wire. Contrast injections revealed a dilated common bile duct above a distal biliary stricture. A digital cholangioscope was introduced, allowing examination of the intrahepatic ducts and CBD down to the duodenum. The stricture was found to be 2 cm in length with features suggestive of malignancy, including erythema and nodularity. A new 8 cm fully covered self-expandable metal stent (FCSEMS) was placed across the H-J with 4 cm of the stent extending into the jejunum.","['Normal esophagus and stomach on limited views', 'Patent gastro-jejunostomy anastomosis', 'Migrated previous fully covered self-expandable metal stent', 'Distal biliary stricture with features suggestive of malignancy', 'Successful placement of new 8 cm FCSEMS across the H-J', 'Biopsies and biliary brushings obtained across the stricture']"
spyglass07,2__outputs,The esophagus and stomach were normal on limited views.,"A scout film of the abdomen was performed. The duodenoscope was advanced to the major papilla without detailed examination of the upper GI tract. The major papilla was normal. The pancreatic duct was unintentionally cannulated and a 5 French 3 cm pancreatic duct stent was placed. The bile duct was then cannulated using a double guide wire technique. Contrast injection under fluoroscopic guidance showed a mildly dilated CBD with a filling defect, confirming the presence of a CBD calculus. A 4 mm biliary sphincterotomy was performed using Erbe electrocautery. An 8 mm balloon sphincteroplasty was performed to facilitate stone removal. A 12 mm stone retrieval balloon was used to perform multiple balloon sweeps, successfully removing the stone. The digital cholangioscope was then advanced, examining the common bile duct, common hepatic duct, and branches next to the hilum, and no abnormalities, mass lesions, or strictures were found. Biopsies were taken from the distal CBD.","['Normal esophagus and stomach on limited views', 'Unintentional cannulation of the pancreatic duct with subsequent placement of a 5 French 3 cm pancreatic duct stent', 'Successful cannulation of the bile duct using a double guide wire technique', 'Mildly dilated CBD with a filling defect, confirming the presence of a CBD calculus', 'Biliary sphincterotomy and sphincteroplasty performed with stone removal using a balloon', 'Normal cholangioscopy examination of the bile ducts with no evidence of strictures or mass lesions', 'Biopsies taken from the distal CBD for further evaluation']"
pdstone04,2__outputs,The esophagus and stomach were normal on limited views.,"A scout film of the abdomen was performed. The duodenoscope was advanced to the major papilla. Previously placed plastic pancreatic duct stents were visualized and removed using rat tooth forceps. Evidence of prior pancreatic sphincterotomy was noted. Pancreatic duct cannulation was performed using a sphincterotome preloaded with a 0.025 inch Visiglide wire, which was challenging due to an alpha loop in the pancreatic duct. An angle tip 0.035 inch jagwire was used to facilitate pancreatic duct access. Contrast injection under fluoroscopy revealed a large radiopaque stone in the distal body of the pancreas. Spyglass pancreatoscopy was performed, which visualized a large calculus. Electrohydraulic lithotripsy (EHL) was attempted using a probe and settings of 15-30, but was unsuccessful in fragmenting the stone. A 7 French 12 cm plastic pancreatic duct stent was placed to localize the calculus for targeted extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL).","['Normal esophagus and stomach on limited views', 'Prior pancreatic sphincterotomy with evidence of previous stent placement', 'Challenging pancreatic duct cannulation due to alpha loop', 'Large radiopaque stone in the distal body of the pancreas', 'Unsuccessful EHL attempt, proceeding with ESWL', '7 French 12 cm plastic pancreatic duct stent placed for targeted ESWL']"
bdstone05,2__outputs,The esophagus and stomach were normal on limited views.,"A scout film prior to insertion was normal. The major papilla was identified in the second portion of the duodenum and had a hook nose configuration. Bile duct cannulation was performed using a sphincterotome and guide wire. A cholangiogram showed a filling defect in the common bile duct, consistent with a stone. Gallstones were also seen in the cystic duct. A biliary sphincterotomy was performed. A stone extraction balloon was used to remove a single stone. A balloon occlusion cholangiogram was normal with no evidence of stricture or further dilation. A 7 French x 5cm Cook Zimmon double pigtail biliary stent was placed successfully.","['Normal esophagus and stomach on limited views', 'Bile duct cannulation successful with sphincterotome and guide wire', 'Common bile duct stone identified and removed', 'Gallstones seen in cystic duct', 'Biliary sphincterotomy performed', '7 French x 5cm biliary stent placed successfully', 'Normal balloon occlusion cholangiogram with good contrast clearance']"
bdstone08,2__outputs,The esophagus and stomach were normal on limited views.,"A scout film confirmed the presence of a previously placed fully covered metal stent. The major papilla was visualized and the stent was removed using rat tooth forceps without resistance. The previous sphincterotomy site was widely patent. The bile duct was deeply cannulated using a stone retrieval balloon preloaded with a 0.035 inch guide wire. The guide wire advanced easily into the intrahepatic ducts. A cholangiogram revealed a dilated CBD measuring 12 mm with normal appearing intrahepatic ducts. Multiple balloon sweeps were performed using a 12 mm balloon, which passed freely through the bile duct with no resistance, and a small amount of sludge was removed. Excellent contrast drainage was noted following the sweeps.","['Normal esophagus and stomach on limited views', 'Successful removal of previously placed fully covered metal stent', 'Patent previous sphincterotomy site', 'Dilated CBD measuring 12 mm with normal intrahepatic ducts', 'Small amount of sludge removed with balloon sweeps', 'Excellent contrast drainage following balloon sweeps']"
