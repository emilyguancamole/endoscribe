bdstricture02,S2_outputs,ESOPHAGUS: Normal on limited views.\n\nSTOMACH: The gastric pouch was unremarkable. The gastro-jejunostomy anastomosis was patent.\n\nDUODENUM: Limited views.,"A scout film of the abdomen was performed. The duodenoscope was advanced to the H-J orifice in the jejunum. The previously placed fully covered self-expandable metal stent had migrated. The intrahepatic ducts were deeply cannulated using a sphincterotome preloaded with a Visiglide 0.025 inch wire. Contrast injections revealed a 12 mm dilation of the common bile duct above a distal biliary stricture. A digital cholangioscope was introduced through the duodenoscope channel allowing thorough examination of the intrahepatic ducts and CBD down to the duodenum. The mucosa at the 2 cm distal CBD stricture showed signs of erythema, nodularity and features suggestive of malignancy. 3 spybite biopsies and biliary brushings were obtained across the strictures. A new 8 cm FCSEMS was placed across the HJ with approximately 4 cm of the stent left extending into the jejunum.","['Normal esophagus, stomach and duodenum on limited views', 'Migrated FCSEMS in the jejunum', 'CBD stricture with features suggestive of malignancy', 'Biopsies and biliary brushings obtained', 'New 8 cm FCSEMS placed across the HJ']"
spyglass07,S2_outputs,ESOPHAGUS: The esophagus was normal on limited views.\n\nSTOMACH: The stomach was normal on limited views.\n\nDUODENUM: Limited views of the second portion of the duodenum showed no abnormalities.,"A scout film of the abdomen was performed. The major papilla was normal but had a long infundibulum requiring a long scope position. The bile duct was deeply cannulated with a sphincterotome preloaded with a hydrojag wire. The pancreatic duct was unintentionally cannulated and a 5 French 3 cm pancreatic duct stent was placed. The bile duct was then cannulated using a double guide wire technique. Contrast injection under fluoroscopic guidance showed a mildly dilated CBD with a filling defect confirming the presence of a CBD calculus. A 4 mm biliary sphincterotomy was performed using ERBE electrocautery. An 8 mm balloon sphincteroplasty was performed to facilitate stone removal. A 12 mm stone retrieval balloon was used to perform multiple balloon sweeps, successfully removing the stone. The spikeless digital cholangioscope was advanced and the common bile duct, common hepatic duct, and branches next to the hilum were examined. No abnormalities, mass lesions, or strictures were found in the bile ducts. Biopsies were taken from the distal CBD for further evaluation. The final contrast injection confirmed that there were no remaining filling defects.","['CBD stone successfully removed', 'Biliary sphincterotomy and sphincteroplasty performed', 'Spyglass cholangioscopy revealed normal bile duct mucosa', 'Biopsies taken from distal CBD']"
pdstone04,S2_outputs,ESOPHAGUS: The esophagus was normal on limited views.\n\nSTOMACH: The stomach was normal on limited views.,"A scout film of the abdomen was performed. The duodenoscope was advanced to the major papilla without detailed examination of the upper GI tract. Previously placed plastic pancreatic duct stents were visualized. The stents were removed using a rat tooth forceps. There was evidence of prior pancreatic sphincterotomy. The pancreatic duct was cannulated with a sphincterotome preloaded with a 0.025 inch Visiglide wire. Cannulation was challenging due to an alpha loop in the pancreatic duct. An angle tip 0.035 inch guidewire was used to facilitate pancreatic duct axis. Contrast injection revealed a large radiolucent stone in the distal body of the pancreas. The SpyGlass pancreatoscope was advanced over the guidewire into the pancreatic duct, where a large calculus was visualized. Electrohydraulic lithotripsy (EHL) was attempted using medium to high power settings, but was unsuccessful in fragmenting the stone. A 7 French 12 cm plastic pancreatic duct stent was placed to localize the calculus for targeted Extracorporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy (ESWL).","['Large pancreatic duct stone in the distal body of the pancreas', 'Pancreatic duct cannulation was challenging due to alpha loop', 'Electrohydraulic lithotripsy (EHL) was attempted but unsuccessful', 'A 7 French 12 cm plastic pancreatic duct stent was placed for targeted ESWL', 'Prior pancreatic sphincterotomy and pancreatic duct stent removal']"
bdstone05,S2_outputs,ESOPHAGUS: The esophagus was normal on limited views.\n\nSTOMACH: The stomach was normal on limited views.\n\nDUODENUM: Limited views of the second portion of the duodenum showed no abnormalities.,"A scout film was performed prior to insertion, which appeared normal. The major papilla was identified in the second portion of the duodenum and had a hook nose configuration with a prominent intramural segment. Bile duct cannulation was performed with ease using a sphincterotome and guide wire. Cholangiogram showed a filling defect in the common bile duct consistent with a stone. Gallstones were also seen in the cystic duct. A biliary sphincterotomy was performed. A stone extraction balloon was used to remove a single stone successfully. A balloon occlusion cholangiogram showed a normal biliary tree with no evidence of stricture or further dilation. Contrast clearance was good. A 7 French x 5cm Cook Zimmon double pigtail biliary stent was placed successfully.","['Bile duct stone successfully removed', 'Biliary sphincterotomy performed', 'A 7 French x 5cm Cook Zimmon double pigtail biliary stent was placed', 'Normal esophagus, stomach, and duodenum on limited views']"
bdstone08,S2_outputs,ESOPHAGUS: The esophagus was normal on limited views.\n\nSTOMACH: The stomach was normal on limited views.,"A scout film confirmed the presence of a previously placed metal stent in the biliary tree. The major papilla was visualized and the fully covered metal stent was seen. The stent was removed using rat tooth forceps without resistance. The previous biliary sphincterotomy was widely patent. The bile duct was deeply cannulated with a stone retrieval balloon preloaded with an 0.035 inch, 450 cm guide wire. The guide wire advanced easily into the intrahepatic ducts. A cholangiogram revealed a dilated CBD measuring 12 mm with normal appearing intrahepatic ducts. Multiple balloon sweeps were performed using a 12-15 mm balloon, starting at the bifurcation and sweeping distally. A small amount of sludge was removed during the sweeps. The 12 mm balloon passed freely through the bile duct with no resistance. There was excellent contrast drainage following the sweeps.","['Metal stent removed from biliary tree', 'Bile duct cannulated with guidewire and balloon', 'Cholangiogram showing dilated CBD with normal intrahepatic ducts', 'Balloon sweeps performed with removal of sludge', 'Excellent contrast drainage following sweeps']"
