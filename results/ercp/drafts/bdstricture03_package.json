  "original_transcript": " Today is February 1st, 2024 and we are in the endoscopy suite. This is Dr. ABC performing an ERCP with stent removal, cannulation of the papilla and stent placement on a 19-year-old male. Indications for the procedure is follow up for a known bile duct stricture, history of hilar biliary stricture and chronic thalassification pancreatitis, initial concern for malignancy, but prior biopsies and imaging showed no evidence of progression, suggesting a benign etiology. The patient has undergone serial ERCPs since 2017 with the last ERCP performed in August 2020, during which a 10 French into 15 cm plastic stent was placed. He now returns for re-examination and stent exchange. I'm beginning the procedure. The patient is in a left semi-prone position and intravenous sedation was administered. I'm advancing the Olympus TJF Q180V duodenoscope was advanced through the mouth, esophagus and stomach, reaching the second part of the duodenum without difficulty. The ERCP finding shows a scout film confirmed the presence of a biliary stent in situ. The duodenoscope was advanced without a detailed upper J-examination. A single plastic stent was visualized at the major papilla and successfully removed using a snare. The prior biliary sphincterotomy was found to be patent. The bile duct was deeply cannulated using a sphincterotome, preloaded with a 0.035-inch guide wire, which was advanced into the intrahepatic ducts with ease. A cholangiogram revealed a mild, short, highlarge structure measuring approximately 5 mm, extending from the hilum bile duct successfully. The scope is now completely withdrawn. There was minimal blood loss. There were no immediate complications. The procedure was successfully completed. End of procedure.",
