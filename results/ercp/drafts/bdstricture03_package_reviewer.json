    "history": "The patient reports a history of follow-up for a known bile duct stricture, history of hilar biliary stricture, and chronic calcific pancreatitis. Initially, there was concern for malignancy, but prior biopsies and imaging showed no evidence of progression, suggesting a benign etiology. No history of progression of malignancy is reported unless otherwise specified.",
    "findings": "A scout film of the abdomen was performed and appeared normal, with a biliary stent in situ. The duodenoscope Olympus TJF Q180V was advanced to the second portion of the duodenum without difficulty and without detailed examination of the upper GI tract. The major papilla was identified and appeared normal in position and morphology, with an intact orifice and no surrounding erythema or edema. After removal of the previously placed stent, evidence of prior sphincterotomy was present, and the orifice was patent. A previously placed plastic stent was seen emerging from the major papilla. The minor papilla could not be located. The ampulla was identified and found to be normal. Bile duct cannulation was attempted using a sphincterotome preloaded with a guidewire (0.035-inch guide wire) and was successful. Biliary cannulation was achieved without pancreatic duct entry. Contrast was injected under fluoroscopic guidance and a cholangiogram was performed. Intrahepatic ducts were normal in caliber, and contrast drained freely into the duodenum. A mild, short, hilar stricture measuring approximately 5 mm, extending from the hilum was noted. A single plastic stent was visualized at the major papilla and successfully removed. Pancreatogram was not performed. Sphincterotomy was performed. A 10 French by 15 cm plastic stent was placed. The scope was then completely withdrawn from the patient and the procedure completed. Estimated blood loss: None. Specimens removed: None. Complications: There were no immediate complications."
