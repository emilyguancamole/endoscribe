spyglass07,EGD was not performed.\n\nESOPHAGUS: Limited views showed no abnormalities.\n\nSTOMACH: Limited views of the stomach showed no abnormalities.\n\nDUODENUM: Limited views of the first and second part of the duodenum showed no abnormalities.,"The major papilla appeared normal but had a long infundibulum requiring a long scope position. The pancreatic duct was unintentionally cannulated. A 5 French 30 mm pancreatic duct stent was placed for pancreatitis prophylaxis. A double guide wire technique was used to successfully cannulate the bile duct. Contrast injection under fluoroscopic guidance showed a mildly dilated CBD, a filling defect confirming the presence of a CBD calculus, a tortuous CBD but no evidence of stricturing, and non-dilated intrahepatic ducts. A 4 mm biliary sphincterotomy was performed using ERBE electrocautery with no bleeding observed. An 8 mm balloon sphincteroplasty was performed to facilitate stone removal. A 12 mm stone retrieval balloon was used to perform multiple balloon sweeps, successfully removing the stone. The spikeless digital cholangioscope was advanced to examine the common bile duct, the common hepatic duct, and branches next to the hilum, with no abnormalities, masses, lesions, or strictures found. Biopsies were taken from the distal CBD for further evaluation. Final contrast injection confirmed no remaining filling defects.","['Normal major papilla with long infundibulum', 'Unintentional pancreatic duct cannulation with placement of 5 French 30 mm pancreatic duct stent for pancreatitis prophylaxis', 'Successful biliary duct cannulation using double guide wire technique', 'Mildly dilated CBD with filling defect confirming presence of CBD calculus', 'Tortuous CBD with no evidence of stricturing', 'Non-dilated intrahepatic ducts', '4 mm biliary sphincterotomy performed using ERBE electrocautery with no bleeding observed', '8 mm balloon sphincteroplasty performed to facilitate stone removal', '12 mm stone retrieval balloon used to perform multiple balloon sweeps, successfully removing the stone', 'No abnormalities, masses, lesions, or strictures found in the common bile duct, common hepatic duct, and branches next to the hilum', 'Biopsies taken from the distal CBD for further evaluation', 'Final contrast injection confirmed no remaining filling defects', 'Limited views of esophagus, stomach and duodenum were normal.']"
pdstone04,EGD was not performed.\n\nESOPHAGUS: Limited views showed no abnormalities.\n\nSTOMACH: Limited views of the stomach showed no abnormalities.\n\nDUODENUM: Limited views of the first and second part of the duodenum showed no abnormalities.,"Previously placed plastic pancreatic duct stents were visualized. The stents were removed using a rat tooth forceps. Evidence of prior pancreatic sphincterotomy was found. Pancreatic duct cannulation was challenging due to the formation of an alpha loop in the pancreatic duct. An angle tip 0.035 inch jaguar wire was used to facilitate pancreatic duct access. Contrast injection under fluoroscopic guidance revealed a large radiopaque stone in the distal body of the pancreas. A spyglass pancreatoscope was advanced over the guide wire into the pancreatic duct, where a large calculus was seen. An EHL probe was advanced into the spyglass pancreatoscope to begin lithotripsy. EHL was attempted using settings of 15 to 30, but the stone could not be fragmented. A 7 French 120 mm plastic pancreatic duct stent was placed to localize the calculus for targeted ESWL. A final contrast injection confirmed that the stent was in good condition.","['Normal limited views of esophagus, stomach, and duodenum.', 'Successful removal of previously placed plastic pancreatic duct stents using rat tooth forceps.', 'Challenging pancreatic duct cannulation due to alpha loop formation.', 'Large radiopaque stone in the distal body of the pancreas.', 'EHL attempted but unable to fragment the stone.', 'Placement of 7 French 120 mm plastic pancreatic duct stent for targeted ESWL.']"
bdstricture02,EGD was not performed.\n\nESOPHAGUS: Limited views showed no abnormalities.\n\nSTOMACH: Limited views of the stomach showed no abnormalities.\n\nDUODENUM: Limited views of the first and second part of the duodenum showed no abnormalities.,"The previously placed fully covered self-expandable metal stent had migrated but the opening to the H-J was successfully identified. The intrahepatic ducts were deeply cannulated using a sphincterotome preloaded with a visiglide 1 wire. Contrast injections revealed a 12 mm dilation of the common bile duct above a distal biliary stricture. The visiglide wire was advanced into the duodenum. A digital cholangioscope was introduced through the duodenoscope channel allowing thorough examination of the intrahepatic ducts and CBD down to the duodenum. A 20 mm distal CBD stricture showed signs of erythema, nodularity, and features suggestive of malignancy. 3 spybite biopsies and biliary brushings were obtained across the strictures. A new 80 mm FCSEMS was placed across the HJ with approximately 40 mm of the stent left extending into the jejunum.","['Limited views of esophagus, stomach and duodenum were normal.', 'Migrated fully covered self-expandable metal stent', 'Successful identification of the H-J opening', '12 mm dilation of the common bile duct above a distal biliary stricture', '20 mm distal CBD stricture with signs suggestive of malignancy', '3 spybite biopsies and biliary brushings obtained across the strictures', 'New 80 mm FCSEMS placed across the HJ with approximately 40 mm of the stent left extending into the jejunum']"
bdstone05,EGD was not performed.\n\nESOPHAGUS: Limited views showed no abnormalities.\n\nSTOMACH: Limited views of the stomach showed no abnormalities.\n\nDUODENUM: Limited views of the first and second part of the duodenum showed no abnormalities.,"The major papilla was identified in the second portion of the duodenum with a hook nose configuration and a prominent intramural segment. Bile duct cannulation was performed with ease using a sphincterotome and a guide wire. A cholangiogram showed a filling defect in the common bile duct consistent with a stone and gallstones within the cystic duct. A biliary sphincterotomy was performed. A single stone was successfully removed using a stone extraction balloon. A balloon occlusion cholangiogram showed no evidence of stricture or further dilation, and contrast clearance was good. A 7 French cross 50 mm Cook Zimmon double pigtail biliary stent was placed successfully.","['Normal limited views of esophagus, stomach, and duodenum.', 'Filling defect in the common bile duct consistent with a stone.', 'Gallstones within the cystic duct.', 'Successful biliary sphincterotomy.', 'Single stone successfully removed from the common bile duct.', 'No evidence of stricture or further dilation on balloon occlusion cholangiogram.', 'Successful placement of a 7 French cross 50 mm Cook Zimmon double pigtail biliary stent.']"
bdstone09,EGD was not performed.\n\nESOPHAGUS: Limited views showed no abnormalities.\n\nSTOMACH: Limited views of the stomach showed no abnormalities.\n\nDUODENUM: Limited views of the first and second part of the duodenum showed no abnormalities.,"A scout film confirmed the presence of surgical clips in the right upper quadrant and the previously placed plastic bile duct stent. The plastic biliary stent was removed using rat tooth forceps without any resistance. There was evidence of prior biliary sphincterotomy. A 9-12 mm stone retrieval balloon preloaded with a 0.035 inch guide wire was used to deeply cannulate the bile duct. An occlusion cholangiogram showed no evidence of filling defects or bile leak. The right hepatic ducts appeared rotated and displaced, likely due to TIPS placement and caudate hypertrophy. The right hepatic ducts were not clearly delineated from the common hepatic ducts. The patient was repositioned from supine to left lateral decubitus. An 8 mm hurricane balloon was used to straighten and sweep the right anterior hepatic duct. There was good bile and contrast flow with no obvious stricture. The previously noticed stricture appeared to have resolved. The common bile duct, common hepatic duct, and right and left main hepatic ducts were non-dilated with no filling defects. Multiple balloon sweeps of the bile duct yielded a small amount of sludge but no stones. There was excellent bile and contrast drainage.","['Plastic biliary stent removed using rat tooth forceps', 'Successful biliary duct cannulation', 'No evidence of filling defects or bile leak on occlusion cholangiogram', 'Right hepatic ducts appeared rotated and displaced, likely due to TIPS placement and caudate hypertrophy', 'No obvious stricture seen in the right anterior hepatic duct', 'Non-dilated common bile duct, common hepatic duct, and right and left main hepatic ducts with no filling defects', 'Small amount of sludge removed from the bile duct with balloon sweeps', 'Limited views of esophagus, stomach and duodenum were normal.']"
bdstone08,EGD was not performed.\n\nESOPHAGUS: Limited views showed no abnormalities.\n\nSTOMACH: Limited views of the stomach showed no abnormalities.\n\nDUODENUM: Limited views of the first and second part of the duodenum showed no abnormalities.,"A scout film confirmed the presence of a previously placed biliary metal stent. The fully covered metal stent was successfully removed using rat tooth forceps without resistance. The previous biliary sphincterotomy was widely patent. The bile duct was deeply cannulated using a stone retrieval balloon preloaded with a 0.035 inch 450 cm guide wire. A cholangiogram revealed a dilated CBD measuring 12 mm with normal appearing intrahepatic ducts. Multiple balloon sweeps were performed with a 12-15 mm balloon, starting at the bifurcation and sweeping distally. A small amount of sludge was removed during the sweeps. The 12 mm balloon passed freely through the bile duct with no resistance. There was excellent contrast drainage following the sweeps.","['Successful removal of fully covered biliary metal stent using rat tooth forceps', 'Widely patent previous biliary sphincterotomy', 'Dilated CBD measuring 12 mm with normal appearing intrahepatic ducts', 'Small amount of sludge removed from the CBD with balloon sweeps', 'Limited views of esophagus, stomach and duodenum were normal.']"
