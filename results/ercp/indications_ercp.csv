Metal bile duct stent was visualized in position. The major papilla was visualized and a previously placed metal bile duct stent was seen. The stent was removed using rat tooth forceps without resistance or bleeding.\n\nThe bile duct was cannulated with a sphincterotome preloaded with a guide wire. Cholangiogram showed no filling defects or stones in the bile duct. Multiple sweeps of the bile duct with a 9-12 mm stone retrieval balloon did not yield any stones or sludge.\n\nThe Spyglass digital cholangioscope was advanced into the duodenoscope channel for direct visualization. The common bile duct, cystic duct stump, common hepatic duct and branches near the hilum were examined. The cystic duct stump was clear with no stones. Erythema was observed around the cystic duct takeoff and common bile duct, likely representing reactive changes. Multiple biopsies were taken from the bile duct in this location.","['Metal bile duct stent removed without resistance or bleeding', 'Cholangiogram showed no filling defects or stones in the bile duct', 'Spyglass cholangioscopy revealed erythema around cystic duct takeoff and common bile duct, likely reactive changes', 'Biopsies taken from bile duct for further evaluation']"
spyglass01,indications_ercp,"87 year old male here for an ERCP for therapy for bile duct stone.\nHe has a history of Billroth II anatomy from previous peptic ulcer disease surgery. His medical history includes COVID-19, atrial fibrillation, bladder issues, bradycardia with a pacemaker, CKD2, dementia, PEG dependence and vocal cord paralysis. He was recently hospitalized for sepsis, pneumonia and ascending cholangitis. A previous ERCP was performed on 12/16/2020, which revealed a large distal bile duct stone. Given the size of the stone, a stent was placed at that time. The patient is now here for a repeat ERCP and further management of the stone, including removal of the stent and stone fragmentation.",EGD not performed.\n\nESOPHAGUS: The esophagus was normal on limited views.\n\nSTOMACH: The stomach was normal on limited views.,"A scout film was not mentioned. The duodenoscope was advanced to the major papilla. The major papilla was identified. A previously placed bile duct stent was seen and removed using rat tooth forceps without issues. There was no bleeding at the site. Evidence of prior biliary sphincterotomy was noted.\n\nThe bile duct was cannulated with a sphincterotome preloaded with a 0.025 inch guide wire. Contrast was injected. Cholangiogram showed a 2 cm calculus in the distal bile duct.\n\nThe Spyglass digital cholangioscope was loaded into the duodenoscope channel. The common bile duct and common hepatic duct were examined. The distal CBD is where the large calculus was located. It appeared to have been partially fragmented, likely due to the stent placement.\n\nElectrohydraulic lithotripsy was performed under normal saline irrigation. The stone was fragmented successfully. A 10 mm balloon sphincteroplasty was performed. A 12-15 mm stone retrieval balloon was used to sweep the bile duct and remove the stone debris. Several balloon sweeps were performed and the stone fragments were completely removed. An occlusion cholangiogram confirmed that there were no remaining stones or filling defects. The bile duct was clear.","['Billroth II anatomy', 'Previously placed CBD stent s/p removal using rat tooth forceps', 'CBD stone identified and fragmented using electrohydraulic lithotripsy', 'Balloon sphincteroplasty and stone retrieval balloon used to remove stone fragments', 'Complete removal of stone fragments with no remaining stones or filling defects']"
pdstone02,indications_ercp,"41 year old female presenting for treatment of chronic obstructive pancreatitis with a large stone in the head of the pancreas. The patient initially presented with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.",The esophagus and stomach appeared normal on detailed examination.,"A scout film of the abdomen was performed prior to duodenoscope insertion and appeared normal. The major papilla was identified and cannulated using a sphincterotome with a 0.025 inch Visiglide guide wire. A pancreatogram showed a tortuous and dilated main pancreatic duct with large filling defects in the head. The guide wire could not be advanced past the obstructing stone. Contrast flowed into the body and tail of the pancreas, suggesting partial obstruction. A 30mm pancreatic sphincterotomy was performed using a blended electro-surgical current. The Spyglass DS digital pancreatic scope was advanced and a large stone obstructing the pancreatic head was visualized. Electrohydraulic lithotripsy (EHL) was attempted but due to positioning challenges, it was difficult to maintain a stable position. Eventually, a large stone was fragmented using EHL at medium power. Small pancreatic stone fragments were seen draining from the pancreatic orifice. Despite these efforts, the guide wire could not be deeply advanced past the obstructing stone.","['Tortuous and dilated main pancreatic duct with large obstructing stone in the head', 'Pancreatic sphincterotomy was performed', 'Spyglass pancreatoscopy revealed a large stone in the pancreatic head', 'Electrohydraulic lithotripsy was used to fragment the stone', 'Procedure was terminated due to prolonged procedure time and CO2 retention']"
