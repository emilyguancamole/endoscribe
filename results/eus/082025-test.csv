cancer01,Llama4,62 year old female with BRCA1 mutation undergoing endoscopic ultrasound for pancreatic screening.,"PANCREAS: The pancreas was visualized from the head to the tail. The parenchyma of the head showed nonspecific hyperechoic foci and strands. The main pancreatic duct in the head measured 2.2 mm, in the neck 1.4 mm, in the body 1.2 mm, and in the tail 0.8 mm. The ducts tapered smoothly with no dilated branch ducts. No masses, strictures, stones, or mural nodules were identified.\n\nBILE DUCT: The common bile duct measured 2.9 mm in diameter and appeared normal with no wall abnormalities, stones, or other findings.\n\nGALLBLADDER: The gallbladder appeared normal with no wall thickening, stones, or pericystic fluid.\n\nLIVER: The liver appeared normal with no focal lesions or abnormalities.\n\nLYMPH NODES: No peripancreatic lymphadenopathy was seen.","EGD not performed. Limited views of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum were obtained.\n\nESOPHAGUS: The mucosa appeared normal with no strictures, erosions, or masses.\n\nSTOMACH: The gastric mucosa appeared normal with no ulcers, erosions, or abnormalities.\n\nDUODENUM: The mucosa appeared normal.","['Normal EUS examination of the pancreas, bile duct, gallbladder, and liver', 'Hyperechoic foci and strands in the pancreas without masses or strictures', 'Normal limited views of the gastric and duodenal mucosa']"
mass01,Llama4,63-year-old female presenting for an EUS for evaluation of pancreatic head mass and dilated pancreatic duct. She had two prior EUS with FNA with non-diagnostic cytology.,"PANCREAS: A 16x14 mm partially circumscribed isoechoic mass with papillary projections was seen obstructing the pancreatic duct at the ampulla with upstream dilation of the duct to 9-12 mm. Fine needle biopsy of the mass at the ampulla was performed using 22 gauge short core needle. A total of 2 passes were obtained with cytotechnologist declaring adequate cellularity.  This was concerning for main duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN). The pancreatic duct tapers in the body to 4.4 mm and we were unable to visualize the duct in the tail. There was a small 3.5x4.6 mm cyst communicating with the pancreatic duct in the body with no concerning features, likely side branch IPMN. There was another intraductal filling defect noted in the upstream duct in the head but this was not biopsied.\n\nBILE DUCT: The common bile duct was normal and measured 4.1-4.6 mm at the ampulla. There was no involvement of the bile duct by the intraductal pancreatic mass.","EGD not performed. Limited views of the esophagus, stomach and duodenum were normal.","['Isoechoic intraductal pancreatic mass at the ampulla with marked upstream dilation of the duct, s/p FNB x2. Concern for main duct IPMN', 'Small branch duct IPMN in the body', 'Separate intraductal filling defect in the head, not biopsied', 'Normal EUS examination of the bile duct']"
