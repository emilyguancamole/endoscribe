cyst01,S1_outputs,"PANCREAS: Multiple anechoic lesions consistent with pancreatic cysts were seen. The largest cyst was in the proximal body around the neck of the pancreas and measured 1.1 cm x 0.65 cm with a thin septation but no mural nodules or solid components. A fine needle aspiration using a 22 gauge needle was performed. A 4.8 mm x 6.4 mm cyst was seen in the pancreatic head. An 8.6 mm x 9.6 mm cyst was seen in the uncinate process. An 8.7 mm x 5.3 mm cyst with a 1.5 mm septation was seen in the pancreatic head. A cluster of sub-centimeter cysts was seen in the body, the largest measuring 6.2 mm x 3.3 mm. A 7.9 mm cyst was seen in the tail. The main pancreatic duct was normal in diameter, measuring 1.4 mm in the head, under 2 mm in the body, and about 1 mm in the tail. There was no evidence of duct wall thickening, strictures, stones, or mural nodules. There was some amount of myelobularity in atrophy with echogenic foci and stranding.\n\nBILE DUCT: The bile duct appeared normal, measuring 3.1 mm.\n\nGALLBLADDER: The gallbladder appeared normal.","EGD not performed. Limited views of the esophagus, stomach and duodenum were normal.","['Multiple pancreatic cysts, largest 1.1 cm x 0.65 cm in the proximal body, s/p FNA', 'Normal EUS examination of the bile duct, gallbladder, and liver', 'Mild pancreatic atrophy with echogenic foci and stranding']"
mass01,S1_outputs,"PANCREAS: A 1.6 cm x 1.4 cm partially circumscribed isoechoic mass with papillary projections was seen obstructing the pancreatic duct at the ampulla with upstream dilation of the duct to 9-12 mm. Fine needle biopsy of the mass at the ampulla was performed using 22 gauge short core needle. A total of 4 passes were obtained with cytotechnologist declaring adequate cellularity.  This was concerning for main duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN). The pancreatic duct tapers in the body to 4.4 mm and we were unable to visualize the duct in the tail. There was a small 3.5mm x 4.6mm cyst communicating with the pancreatic duct in the body with no concerning features, likely side branch IPMN. There was another intraductal filling defect noted in the upstream duct in the head but this was not biopsied.\n\nBILE DUCT: The common bile duct was normal and measured 4.1-4.6 mm at the ampulla. There was no involvement of the bile duct by the intraductal pancreatic mass.\n\nLIVER: No suspicious lesions or abnormalities.","EGD not performed.

mass02,S1_outputs,"STOMACH: A 27x14 mm heterogeneous and hypoechoic lesion was seen originating from the muscularis propria with a small 7x7 mm anechoic area within.

The main pancreatic duct measured 1.2 mm in the head, 0.8 mm in the body, and 0.7 mm in the tail, with a smooth taper and no evidence of echogenic duct wall thickening. Two pancreatic cysts were identified: one in the body measuring 4.2 mm, well-defined, single-chambered, thin-walled, without septations or mural nodules, and no communication with the main pancreatic duct; and one in the neck measuring 4.2 x 3.7 mm, with similar characteristics.\n\nBILE DUCT: The common bile duct was normal in caliber, measuring 2.6 mm, with no strictures, stones, or abnormalities.\n\nGALLBLADDER: The gallbladder appeared normal, with no wall thickening, pericholecystic fluid, or stones.\n\nLIVER: The visualized portion of the liver appeared normal, with no focal lesions or abnormalities.\n\nLYMPH NODES: No peripancreatic, perigastric, or celiac axis lymph nodes were visualized.","EGD not performed.
