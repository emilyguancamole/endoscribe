mass01,,63,F,"PANCREAS: There is a 16 mm x 14 mm partially circumscribed isoechoic mass with papillary projections at the ampulla, obstructing the pancreatic duct. Upstream pancreatic duct dilation is noted, measuring 9 to 12 mm, tapering to 4.4 mm in the body. The duct is not visualized in the tail. There is a 3.5 mm x 4.6 mm cyst communicating with the pancreatic duct in the body. An additional intraductal filling defect is observed in the pancreatic duct within the head. A biopsy was performed on the ampullary mass using a 22 gauge short core needle.\n\nBILE DUCT: The common bile duct is of normal caliber, measuring between 4.1 mm and 4.6 mm at the ampulla.","The visualized portions of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum were normal.","['Partially circumscribed isoechoic mass with papillary projections at the ampulla, obstructing the pancreatic duct', 'Upstream pancreatic duct dilation', 'Small cyst communicating with the pancreatic duct in the body', 'Intraductal filling defect in the pancreatic duct within the head', 'Biopsy performed on the ampullary mass', 'Normal EGD examination of esophagus, stomach, and duodenum']"
mass02,,77,F,"STOMACH: A 27 mm by 14 mm heterogeneous, hypoechoic lesion originating from the muscularis propria with a 7 mm by 7 mm anechoic area within it. FNA was done using a 22 gauge needle with three passes.\n\nPANCREAS: The pancreas appears normal with no abnormalities or dilation in the main pancreatic duct.\n\nBILE DUCT: The common bile duct appears normal and measures 1.4 mm in diameter with no evidence of stones, wall thickening, or dilation.",ESOPHAGUS: The mucosa is normal.\n\nSTOMACH: A 20 mm subepithelial lesion with a central ulcer along the higher left curve and anterior wall. Bite-on-bite biopsies were performed.\n\nDUODENUM: The mucosa appears normal without evidence of a mass or other abnormalities.,"['27 mm by 14 mm heterogeneous, hypoechoic lesion in the stomach with a 7 mm by 7 mm anechoic area within it, FNA performed', 'Normal EUS examination of pancreas and bile duct', '20 mm subepithelial lesion with a central ulcer in the stomach, biopsies performed']"
