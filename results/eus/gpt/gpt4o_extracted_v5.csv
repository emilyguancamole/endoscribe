cyst09,"PANCREAS: The pancreatic parenchyma showed scattered foci, strands, and myelobularity, but no discrete masses or calcifications. The main pancreatic duct was not dilated. It measured about 1.2 mm in the head, 0.8 mm in the body, and 0.7 mm in the tail. The duct showed a smooth taper with no evidence of echogenic duct wall thickening. There were no strictures or stones in the duct. There were no mass lesions. Two pancreatic cysts were identified. The pancreatic body cyst measured about 4.2 mm. It was well defined, single chambered, thin-walled without septations or mural nodules. There were no calcifications and no communication with the main pancreatic duct. The pancreatic neck cyst measured 4.2 mm by 3.7 mm. It was well defined, single chambered, thin-walled without septations or mural nodules. There were no calcifications and no communication with the main pancreatic duct.\n\nBILE DUCT: The common bile duct was normal in caliber measuring about 2.6 mm. No strictures, stones, or abnormalities were noted.\n\nGALLBLADDER: The gallbladder appeared to be normal with no wall thickening, pericholecystic fluid, or stones.\n\nLIVER: The visualized portion of the liver appeared to be normal. There were no focal lesions or abnormalities.\n\nLYMPH NODES: There were no peripancreatic, perigastric, or celiac axis lymph nodes visualized.","The esophagus, stomach, and duodenum appeared normal.","['Normal EUS examination of the pancreas, bile duct, gallbladder, liver, and lymph nodes', 'Two pancreatic cysts: one in the body measuring 4.2 mm and one in the neck measuring 4.2 mm by 3.7 mm']"
cyst05,"PANCREAS: No pancreatic masses were identified. The pancreatic parenchyma showed a few echogenic foci and stranding, but was otherwise unremarkable. The main pancreatic duct (MPD) was not dilated and measured about 3 mm in the neck of the pancreas. The duct wall was not echogenic and there were no dilated side branches. There were no pancreatic calcifications or any other abnormalities on the border. Multiple pancreatic cysts consistent with multifocal branch duct IPMN were seen. The first pancreatic body cyst was about 29 mm in diameter with possible ductal communication, mucin debris, and a hyperechoic rim, but no solid nodules or other concerning features. The second pancreatic body cyst was about 6 mm in length, also containing mucin debris with a hyperechoic rim. The third pancreatic body cyst was about 4 mm in diameter. A pancreatic tail cyst about 45 mm was well defined, filled with debris, and likely a pseudocyst. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) was performed using a 22 gauge needle. Clear fluid was aspirated from the 29 mm pancreatic body cyst with a single pass. Clear fluid was aspirated from the 6 mm pancreatic body cyst with a single pass. Debris-filled fluid was aspirated from the 45 mm pancreatic tail cyst with a single pass.\n\nBILE DUCT: The bile duct was normal in caliber with a thin duct wall and no dilation or stones.\n\nGALLBLADDER: The gallbladder appeared to be filled with microplasticity, but there was no sludge, urofibroma, or pericholecystic fluid.\n\nLIVER: The visualized portions of the left lobe of the liver appeared to be normal with no focal lesions or suspicious findings.\n\nADRENAL GLANDS: The left adrenal gland appeared to be normal.\n\nAORTA AND CELIAC AXIS: The visualized portions of the aorta and celiac axis appeared to be normal with no aneurysms or abnormal vascular structures.\n\nSPLEEN: The visualized portions of the spleen appeared to be normal.","ESOPHAGUS: The esophageal mucosa appeared normal with no erosions, nodularities, or strictures.\n\nSTOMACH: A bulge with erythema, likely from an adjacent pseudocyst, was observed. There was no evidence of active bleeding or ulcerations.\n\nDUODENUM: The mucosa appeared normal without any villous blunting or ulcerations.","['Multiple pancreatic cysts consistent with multifocal branch duct IPMN', '29 mm pancreatic body cyst with possible ductal communication, s/p FNA with clear fluid aspirated', '6 mm pancreatic body cyst, s/p FNA with clear fluid aspirated', '45 mm pancreatic tail cyst, likely a pseudocyst, s/p FNA with debris-filled fluid aspirated', 'Normal EUS examination of the bile duct, liver, adrenal glands, aorta and celiac axis, and spleen', 'Normal EGD examination of the esophagus and duodenum', 'Bulge with erythema in the stomach, likely from an adjacent pseudocyst']"
mass03,"PANCREAS: A 52x40 mm heterogeneous hypoechoic mass was seen in the pancreatic body extending into the pancreatic neck, abutting the portal confluence and the celiac takeoff. The main pancreatic duct was dilated to 8 mm upstream to the mass, and the parenchyma appeared atrophic. Fine needle biopsy of the mass was performed using a 22-gauge SharkCore needle. A total of 3 passes were obtained under ultrasound guidance with color Doppler, and adequate samples were acquired.\n\nBILE DUCT: The bile duct was normal and measured 2.2-3.1 mm in diameter.\n\nGALLBLADDER: The gallbladder appeared normal with no evidence of wall thickening, stones, or pericholecystic fluid.\n\nLYMPH NODES: Two peripancreatic lymph nodes were seen adjacent to the pancreatic head, measuring 14 mm and 12 mm.\n\nLIVER: The liver showed no suspicious lesions or abnormalities.","EGD not performed. Limited views of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum were normal.","['Heterogeneous hypoechoic mass in the pancreatic body extending into the pancreatic neck, s/p FNB x3.', 'Dilated main pancreatic duct upstream to the mass.', 'Atrophic pancreatic parenchyma upstream to the mass.', 'Normal bile duct.', 'Normal gallbladder.', 'Two peripancreatic lymph nodes adjacent to the pancreatic head.', 'Normal liver.', 'Normal limited views of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum.']"
mass10,"PANCREAS: A 34.9x29.1 mm poorly defined and heterogeneous mass was seen in the pancreatic head/uncinate process. The main pancreatic duct traversed through the lesion and was dilated, measuring 4.3 mm. Fine needle aspiration of the mass was performed using a 22-gauge SharkCore needle. A total of 4 passes were obtained.\n\nBILE DUCT: The common bile duct measured 5.3 mm.\n\nLYMPH NODES: A peripancreatic lymph node was enlarged, measuring 13.2 mm.","The esophagus, stomach, and duodenum appeared normal.","['Poorly defined and heterogeneous mass in the pancreatic head/uncinate process, s/p FNA x4', 'Dilated main pancreatic duct traversing through the lesion', 'Enlarged peripancreatic lymph node', 'Normal EGD examination of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum']"
cancer05,"PANCREAS: The pancreas exhibited diffuse hyperechoic focal end strands with no discrete masses. There was diffuse lobularity throughout the pancreas, not meeting criteria for chronic pancreatitis. The tail appeared fatty with consistent focal fat infiltration. The main pancreatic duct was normal in caliber with no echogenic duct wall thickening, strictures, stones, or mural nodules.\n\nBILE DUCT: The common bile duct appeared normal, measuring about 4.5 mm with no dilation, stones, or wall thickening.\n\nLIVER: The liver appeared normal with no focal lesions or suspicious findings.\n\nLYMPH NODES: No peripancreatic, perigastric, or celiac axis lymph nodes were visualized.","The esophagus, stomach, and duodenum appeared normal.","['Diffuse hyperechoic focal end strands in the pancreas with no discrete masses', 'Diffuse lobularity in the pancreas, not meeting criteria for chronic pancreatitis', 'Fatty tail of the pancreas with focal fat infiltration', 'Normal main pancreatic duct', 'Normal common bile duct', 'Normal liver', 'No peripancreatic, perigastric, or celiac axis lymph nodes visualized']"
