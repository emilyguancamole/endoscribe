Fine needle biopsy of the mass at the ampulla was performed using 22 gauge short core needle. A total of 2 passes were obtained with cytotechnologist declaring adequate cellularity.  This was concerning for main duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN). The pancreatic duct tapers in the body to 4.4 mm and we were unable to visualize the duct in the tail. There was a small 3.5x4.6 mm cyst communicating with the pancreatic duct in the body with no concerning features, likely side branch IPMN. There was another intraductal filling defect noted in the upstream duct in the head but this was not biopsied.\n\nBILE DUCT: The common bile duct was normal and measured 4.1-4.6 mm at the ampulla. There was no involvement of the bile duct by the intraductal pancreatic mass.","EGD not performed. Limited views of the esophagus, stomach and duodenum were normal.","['Isoechoic intraductal pancreatic mass at the ampulla with marked upstream dilation of the duct, s/p FNB x2.

cyst01,indications_eus,"Female patient with incidentally detected pancreatic cyst on CTA, presenting for evaluation.","PANCREAS: Multiple anechoic lesions consistent with pancreatic cysts were seen. The largest cyst was in the proximal body/ neck of the pancreas, measuring 11 x 6.5 mm with a thin septation but no mural nodules or solid components. A 4.8 x 6.4 mm cyst was seen in the pancreatic head. An 8.6 x 9.6 mm cyst was seen in the uncinate process. An 8.7 x 5.3 mm cyst with a 1.5 mm septation was seen in the pancreatic head. A cluster of sub-centimeter cysts was seen in the body, with the largest measuring 6.2 x 3.3 mm. A 7.9 mm cyst was seen in the tail. The main pancreatic duct was normal in diameter, measuring 1.4 mm in the head, <2 mm in the body, and 1 mm in the tail, with no duct wall thickening, strictures, stones, or mural nodules. There was some degree of lobularity and atrophy with echogenic foci and stranding.\n\nBILE DUCT: The bile duct appeared normal, measuring 3.1 mm.\n\nGALLBLADDER: The gallbladder appeared normal.\n\nLIVER: The liver appeared normal.\n\nLYMPH NODES: No peripancreatic lymphadenopathy was seen.","EGD not performed. Limited views of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum were normal.","['Multiple pancreatic cysts, largest 11 x 6.5 mm in the proximal body/neck, with FNA performed', 'Normal main pancreatic duct', 'Normal bile duct, gallbladder, liver, and lymph nodes']"
cyst02,indications_eus,"69 year old male with history of esophageal cancer, left breast cancer, adrenal cortical adenoma, and adrenal hyperplasia, presenting for evaluation of a pancreatic cystic lesion. A pancreatic protocol CT from December 30th, 2023 revealed a 1.8 cm pancreatic body cyst with a questionable thin septation, suspected to be a side branch IPMN.","PANCREAS: The pancreatic parenchyma appeared mildly lobular with echogenic foci and strands consistent with chronic changes.

A larger cyst in the distal body measured 23.7 x 13.8 mm, was multiloculated with thin septations and thin walls, and no mural nodules or calcifications. A 22-gauge fine needle was used to aspirate fluid from the larger cyst, yielding 3 ml of fluid for molecular marker analysis.

The main pancreatic duct was not dilated, measuring 3mm in the neck. Multiple pancreatic cysts were identified, consistent with multifocal branch duct IPMN. The cysts measured 9mm in the head, 9mm in the body, and 5mm in the tail. An elongated cluster of cysts measuring 25mm was seen in the pancreatic head with ductal communication. No solid nodules or concerning features were identified. FNA was performed using a 22 gauge needle into the largest cyst in the head, yielding clear fluid for DNA molecular marker analysis.\n\nBILE DUCT: The bile duct appeared normal in caliber with a thin duct wall, no stones, strictures, or dilations.\n\nGALLBLADDER: The gallbladder appeared normal with no wall thickening, stones, or pericholecystic fluid.\n\nADRENAL GLANDS: The left adrenal gland appeared normal.\n\nAORTA AND CELIAC AXIS: The aorta and celiac axis appeared normal with no aneurysms or abnormal vascular structures.\n\nLIVER: The visualized portions of the left lobe of the liver appeared normal with no suspicious findings or focal lesions.\n\nSPLEEN: The visualized portions of the spleen appeared normal.","ESOPHAGUS: LA grade B esophagitis with mucosal breaks involving more than one mucosal fold, but not circumferentially, was observed. No nodularity, strictures, or masses were seen.\n\nSTOMACH: The gastric mucosa appeared normal with no ulcerations or mass lesions.\n\nDUODENUM: The mucosa appeared normal with no erythema, ulcerations, or villous blunting.","['Multifocal branch duct IPMN with cysts in the head, body, and tail of the pancreas', 'LA grade B esophagitis', 'Normal EUS examination of the bile duct, gallbladder, adrenal glands, aorta, celiac axis, liver, and spleen']"
