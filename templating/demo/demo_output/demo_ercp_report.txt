== DESCRIPTION_OF_PROCEDURE ==

After the risks, benefits and alternatives of the procedure were thoroughly explained, informed consent was verified, confirmed and timeout was successfully executed by the treatment team. With the patient in the left semi-prone position, medications were administered intravenously. The duodenoscope TJF-Q190V was passed from the mouth into the esophagus and further advanced from the esophagus into the stomach. From the stomach, the scope was directed to the second portion of the duodenum.

== ERCP_QUALITY_METRICS ==

Difficulty of ERCP: Grade 2.
Pancreatic duct cannulation Not_attempted.
Cannulation success: Yes.
Post-ERCP pancreatitis prophylaxis: Lactated ringers: Yes, refer to record of source.
Rectal indomethacin: No.
Successful completion of intended procedure: Yes.
Failed ERCP from another facility or provider: No.

== FINDINGS ==

A scout film of the abdomen was performed and appeared normal.

The duodenoscope TJF-Q190V was advanced to the second portion of the duodenum without difficulty and without detailed examination of the upper GI tract. The esophagus, stomach, and duodenum appeared unremarkable on limited inspection.

The major papilla was identified. The papilla appeared edematous. After removal of the previously placed stent, evidence of prior sphincterotomy was present. Periampullary diverticulum present. Papilla located inside the diverticulum.

The minor papilla was identified and inspected. It appeared normal in position and morphology, with an intact orifice and no surrounding erythema or edema.

Bile duct cannulation was unsuccessful.  The procedure was terminated.

Contrast injection was not performed.

Adjunct stone therapy was performed due to large stones. Initial extraction was attempted with balloon. Complete clearance was achieved.

Endoscopic papillary large balloon dilation was performed without sphincterotomy because of bleeding risk. A CRE balloon was used with target diameter 15mm. Inflation was performed using graded stepwise strategy for 60 seconds. Balloon waist was present and resolved. Overall outcome was successful.

Limitations: Poor visualization due to bile.
Final assessment of duct clearance: partial.
Small non-obstructing stone remains, expected to pass. Bile drainage was adequate after stone extraction.
A final fluoroscopic image was obtained for confirmation.

The scope was then completely withdrawn from the patient and the procedure completed.
