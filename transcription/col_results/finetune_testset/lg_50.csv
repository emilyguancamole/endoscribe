163, Here is test patient 163. He is a 68 year old man coming here for a colonoscopy screening for average risk of colorectal cancer. His last colonoscopy was 5 years ago. The overall prep quality is adequate. The colonoscope is introduced through the anus and advanced till the cecum. The Boston Bowel Prep Score Boston scale in the right colon is 2. In the transverse colon is 2. And the Boston Bowel Prep Score Boston scale in left colon is 3. So the total Boston Bowel Prep Score is 7. The colonoscope is advanced through the anus into the cecum and which is identified by the appendix and the ileocecal valve. The colonoscopic mucosa is then carefully examined in a circumferential fashion on the scope during withdrawal. There is small and medium-sized diverticula throughout the colon consistent with moderate diverticulosis. No polyp is seen during the withdrawal. The colonoscope is removed completely and the examination is complete.
Report_14_3," I am able to reach the cecum and the cecum looks normal. The appendiceal orifice ileocecal valve appears normal. On my way back, the descending colon looks normal. A mild diverticulosis in the sigmoid colon and retroflexion completely normal. I am withdrawing the scope and the procedure is complete. End of procedure 14."
Report_14_2," and I am seeing some polyps on my way in. I am seeing some polyps in the transverse colon. So this is Paris 1S, NICE classification type 2 polyp. So there are two polyps ranging from 4 to 6 mm in size in the transverse colon. So I am taking the polyps out using cold snare polypectomy technique and I am able to get the polyp tissue out."
63," This is test 63 and we are here with a 54 year old male who is here for a colonoscopy for the assessment following an average risk of colorectal cancer. The last procedure performed was in 2013 and I am now beginning the procedure. I am now inserting the scope. Scope is in and I'm now advancing the scope through the rectum to the sigmoid colon. I'm now in the left colon. The prep quality seems adequate. I am in the left colon and the prep score is 3. I'm advancing the scope up the descending colon through to the transverse colon and the prep quality is almost adequate. The prep score is 2. I'm now advancing the scope to the right colon and the prep score is 3, which brings the the overall Boston Bowel Prep score to 8. I am now advancing the scope up to the cecum. I've had no trouble getting the scope through to the cecum. I'm able to identify the ileocecal valve and the appendix. The cecum appears normal. I am now beginning withdrawal of the scope. On my way back, in the ascending colon, I am able to see a polyp, a flat elevation of the mucosa, which seems to be a polyp. It's about 10 mm in size with a Paris classification of 02A. and anise classification of type 1. I am beginning endoscopic mucosal resection. I am doing it piecemeal. I am injecting saline and methylene blue submucosally and I am attempting to raise the lesion. I am attempting resection with cold snare. The polyp is lifted well. Yes, advance the scope please. And the resection is now complete. I've retrieved the polyp tissue and I'm now withdrawing the scope further. I'm able to see a polyp about 3 mm in size in the transverse colon. It's a Paris Classification 1S sessile polyp. I'm using a col-snare to conduct a polypectomy. Polypectomy is now complete. And the tissue is now completely retrieved. I am now withdrawing the scope. The remainder of the colon seems unremarkable to me. The scope is now out. And this is the end of the procedure."
33," Hi this is test 33 we have a 53 year old male for a colonoscopy for assessment of average risk for colorectal cancer he has no prior history of colonoscopies and I'm starting the procedure now now I'm inserting the scope through the anus and I am moving towards the descending colon I see the oral prep quality is adequate and the Boston Bowel prep score in the descending colon is 2 now I am in the transverse colon and the Boston Bowel prep score in the transverse colon is 3 now I am moving to the right colon and the Boston Bowel preparation of right colon that is ascending colon score is 3 the overall score is 8 now I I'm carefully advancing through the cecum I see illiosecal valve and appendiceal orifice the cecum looks normal now I'm withdrawing the scope I in the ascending transverse descending sigmoid colon rectum I see no remarkable findings as As I'm withdrawing, I see there's no masses, polyps or mucosal abnormalities. There's no abnormality in the retroflexed view. I'm removing the scope completely from the patient. Scope is out. The procedure is completed. Test 33."
