163,"Here is Test Patient 163. He is a 68 year old man coming here for a colonoscopy screening for average risk of colorectal cancer. His last colonoscopy was 5 years ago. The overall prep quality is adequate. is adequate. The colonoscope is introduced through the anus and advanced till the cecum. The Boston Boul Prep Score Boston Scale in the right colon is 2. In the transverse colon is 2. And the Boston Boul Prep Score Boston scale in left colon is 3. So the total Boston Bowel Prep score is 7. The colonoscope is advanced through the anus into the cecum and which is identified by the appendix and the Ilyosal valve. The colonoscope colonoscopic mucosa is then carefully examined in a circumferential fashion on the scope during the during the withdrawal. There is small and medium sized diverticular throughout the colon consistent with the moderate diverticulosis. No polyp is seen during the withdrawal. The colonoscope is removed completely and the examination is complete. I'm going to be"
63,"This is test 63 and we are here with a 54 year old male who is here for a colonoscopy for the assessment following an average risk of colorectal cancer. The last procedure performed was in 2013 and I am now beginning the procedure I am now inserting the scope scope is in and I am now advancing the scope through the rectum to the sigmoid colon I'm now in the left colon the prep quality seems adequate I am in the left colon and the prep score is 3 I'm advancing the scope up the descending colon through to the transverse colon and the prep quality is almost adequate the prep score is 2 I'm now advancing the scope to the right colon and the prep score is 3 which brings the overall Boston bowel prep score to 8 I am now advancing the scope up to the To the cecum I have had no trouble getting the scope through to the cecum. I am able to identify the iliacicle valve and the appendix. The cecum appears normal. I am not beginning with the scope. On my way back, I am not in the ascending colon, I am able to see a polyp, a flat elevation the mucosa which seems to be a polyp it's about 10 millimeters in size with a Paris classification of 0 2a and a nice classification of type 1 I'm beginning endoscopic mucosal resection I am doing it piecemeal I am I am injecting saline and methylene blue sub-mucosally and I am attempting to raise the lesion. I am attempting resection with cold snare. The polyp is lifted well. and the resection is now complete I have retrieved the polyp tissue and I am now withdrawing the scope further I am able to see a palp about 3mm size in the transatlum in the transverse colon. It's a Paris classification 1 Scyl polyp. I'm using a cold snare to conduct the polypectomy. Polypectomy is now complete and the tissue is now completely retrieved. I'm now drawing the scope. The remainder of the colon seems and remarkable to me and the scope is now out and this is the end of the procedure"
33," Hi, this is test 33. We have a 53 year old male for a colonoscopy for assessment of average risk for colorectal cancer. He has no prehistory of colonoscopies and I'm starting the procedure now. Now I'm inserting the scope through the anus and I am moving towards the descending colon. I see the overall prep quality is adequate and the Boston Bowenberg prep score in the descending colon is 2. Now I am in the transfer colon and the Boston Bowenberg prep score in the transverse colon is 3. Now I am moving to the right colon and the Boston board preparation of right colon that is ascending colon score is 3 the overall score is 8. Now I am carefully advancing through the Secom I see Eleocecal VEV and appendice The cecum looks normal Now I am withdrawing the scope In the ascending transverse descending Ccumacolone rectum I see no remarkable findings As I am withdrawing I see there is no muscles, polyps or mucosal abnormalities There is no abnormalities There is no abnormal There is no abnormality in the retroflexed view. I am removing the scope completely from the patient. The scope is out. The procedure is completed."
