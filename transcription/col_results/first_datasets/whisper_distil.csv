163, Here is Test Patient 163. He is a 68 year old man coming here for a colonoscopy screening for average risk of colorectal cancer. His last colonoscopy was 5 years ago. The overall prep quality is adequate. is adequate. The colonoscope is introduced through the anus and advanced till the Secom. The Boston Boul Prep Score Boston scale in the right colon is 2. In the transfer colon is 2. And the Boston Boul Prep Score Boston scale in left colon is 3. So the total Boston ball prep score is 7. The colonoscope is advanced through the anus into the cecum and which is identified by the appendix and the Ilyosicle valve. The colonoscope colonoscopic mucosa is then carefully examined in a circumferential fashion on the scope during withdrawal. There is small and medium sized diverticular throughout the colon consistent with my moderate diverticulosis. No polyp is seen during the withdrawal. The colonoscope is removed completely and the examination is complete. I'm
63," This is test 63 and we're here with a 54 year old male who's here for a colonoscopy for the assessment following an average risk of colorectal cancer. The last procedure performed was in 2013 and I'm now beginning the procedure. I'm now inserting the scope. scope is in and I'm now advancing the scope through the rectum to the sigmoid colon I'm now in the left colon the prep quality seems adequate I am in the left colon and the prep score is three I'm advancing the scope up the descending colon through to the transoes colon and the prep quality is almost adequate. The prep score is 2. I'm now advancing the scope to the right colon, and the prep score is 3, which brings the overall Boston ball prep score to 8. I am now advancing the scope up to the Seacom. I've had no trouble getting the scope through to the Seacom. I'm able to identify the Ilyosicle valve and the appendix. The Seacom appears normal. I'm now beginning withdrawal of the scope. On my way back, I'm not in the ascending cross. In the ascending colon, I'm able to see a polyp, a flat elevation of the mucosa, which seems to be a polyp. It's about 10 millimeters in size with a Paris classification of 0.2a and a Nice classification of type 1. I'm beginning endoscopic mucosal resection. I'm doing endoscopic mucosal resection. I'm doing, it piecemeal I am injecting saline and methylene blue sub-mucosally and I am attempting to raise a lesion I am attempting resection with cold snare the polyp is lifted well and the restriction is now complete. I've retrieved the polyp tissue and I'm now withdrawing the scope further. I'm able to see a parliap about 3mm size in the transverse colon. It's a Paris classification 1 Sassile polyp. I'm using a colesnare to conduct the polypec polypectomy is now complete and the tissue is now completely retrieved I'm now withdrawing the scope the remainder of the colon seems unremarkable to me and the scope is now out and this is the end of the procedure"
33," Hi, this is test 33. We have a 53 year old male for a colonoscopy for assessment of average risk for colorectal cancer. He has no prehistory of colonoscopies and I'm starting the procedure now. Now I'm inserting the scope through the anus and I am moving towards the descending colonel. I see the overall prep quality is adequate and the Boston ball prep score in the descending colon is 2 now I'm in the transfer colon and the Boston ball prep score in the dancer's colon is 3 now I'm moving to the right colon and the Boston ball preparation of right colon that is ascending colon the score is 3 the overall score is 8 now I'm carefully advancing through the sikum I see illocetal valve and appendice the the sycam looks normal now I'm withdrawing the scope I in the ashening transverse disinning sigma colorectum I see no remarkable findings as I'm withdrawing I see there's no masses polyps or mucosal abnormalities There is no abnormality in the retroflexed view.
