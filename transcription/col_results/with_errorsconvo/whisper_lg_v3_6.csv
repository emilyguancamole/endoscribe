11," Hi, this is test 11. Today is 14th September 2024. We have a 46-year-old female here for a colonoscopy to assess for cecal polyps. Her last colonoscopy was performed on April 2024, and now I'm beginning the procedure. Scope in. Okay, great. She's asleep. She's doing well. Excellent. I'm inserting the scope through the anus. I'm carefully advancing through the rectum. I'm continuing to pass into the sigmoid colon. Now I'm entering the descending colon. Moving further, I see the splenic flexor followed by the transverse colon. Now I see the hepatic flexor. I'm going to need some pressure here, please. Yes, please. Thank you so much. It's just hard advancing here. Mm-hmm. Thank you. Can we reposition her a little bit? Perfect. Excellent. Okay. All right. And how was your Friday, everybody? How was your Friday, everybody? Last weekend after we left? Good. What'd you end up doing? Did you watch that movie? Hmm. Good. Now I'm advancing through the ascending colon. Now I'm advancing through the cecum. I see the appendiceal orifice and the ileocecal valve. The Boston bowel prep score is overall adequate, I would say. The Boston prep score in the right colon is... Transverse colon is 3, transverse colon is 3, and left colon is 2, actually, I'm sorry, it's actually 3, okay? Left colon is 3. Total score would be 9. The cecum is normal in the cecum. And next to the appendiceal orifice, I see a 20-millimeter laterally splitting lesion. Which does not involve the appendiceal orifice. It's Paris LST GM0 2A plus 1S. JNET classification 2A. Okay. Okay. Can I please get a hot snare? Okay. Okay, thank you so much. And lifting agent. Now I'm dissecting the lesion in a piecemeal fashion with endoscopic mucosal resection. I'm lifting the lesion, demarcating with a premixed solution of hetastarch and methylene blue. And I'm using a 10-millimeter captivator snare. No, actually, sorry. No, yeah, it is 10-millimeter. I'm treating the resection is complete. And I'm treating the margin of the resected area using a snare soft tip coagulation. Now I'm closing the defect with two mantis clips. I retrieved the specimen with a Rothnet. And I'm removing the scopes. And I'm removing the scopes. And I'm removing the scopes. I know it's tough when they're young. Okay. Now I am withdrawing the specimen with the Rothnet. And I'm withdrawing the scope. And the sigmoid colon, I see a five-millimeter sessile polyp. Paris. 0 to 1A. Sorry, Paris 0 to 1S. Nice 2. I'm resecting this with a cold snare. Resection is completed. As I'm withdrawing, I'm in the rectosigmoid at 20 centimeters from the anal verge. I see a 20-millimeter pseudodepressed lateral splitting region. I'm attempting to lift this lesion with a premixed solution of head of starch and methylene blue. But it's not lifting. I'm not able to lift the lesion. Okay. I'm taking a biopsy from the center of the lesion with a cold forceps and sending this for histology. I'm placing a tattoo. Two-centimeter distal. Two on the opposite wall of the lesion. I'm withdrawing the scope. The scope is out. There were no complications during the procedure. This is the end of procedure test 11."
16," This is test 16. We have a 65-year-old female who's coming for colonoscopy for personal history of colon polyps. Her last colonoscopy was performed a year ago. I'm beginning the procedure now. I'm inserting the scope through the anus. The scope is in. Carefully advancing through the rectum. Is he oxygenating well? Everything's going okay? Okay, that's good, that's good. Do you need me to move anything here with the oxygen mask? No? Okay, that sounds good. So, continuing to pass through the sigmoid, going through the descending colon. Now we're in the transverse colon. Continuing towards the ascending colon. We are in the ascending colon. Pamela, did you end up cooking that turkey roast for everybody? Oh, that's amazing. That's wonderful. Hope you guys enjoyed it. Mm-hmm. Great. The Boston bowel prep score is being assessed along the way. The overall quality is adequate. The Boston bowel prep score in the right colon is 3. Transverse colon is 1. No, wait, sorry. 3. Transverse colon is 3. Left colon is 3. Total score of... 9. Now we are in the cecum. I see the appendiceal orifice and the ileocecal valve. I see 5 polyps measuring from 3 to 13 millimeters in size. All are Paris 0 to 1S and Nice type 2. The 13 millimeter polyp, I'm using saline to demarcate. And lift the lesion. Now I'm resecting the polyp. Polyp is resected. Can I please have the hot snare? Mm-hmm. Okay. Yep. Yep. Okay. Bring it down a little bit. Yep. Okay. Can you just turn it around a little? Okay, perfect. So the polyp is resected using hot endoscopic causal resection. It is... Polyp is out. I'm removing the other polyps with cold snare. All polyps are retrieved. You have it, right? You do? Okay, great. Now I'm withdrawing the scope. In the ascending colon, I see a 15 millimeter polyp and a 5 millimeter polyp. Actually, sorry, the 15 millimeter one is actually 10 millimeters on closer inspection. They're both Paris 0 to 1S, NIS type 2. I'm using a cold snare to retrieve the polyp. Polyp is out. Now I'm withdrawing the scope. Are you going to the colon cancer awareness marathon this... This... This... Upcoming weekend? Yeah, we're going to try to make it. Now I'm in the sigmoid colon. I see a 5 millimeter and a 10 millimeter polyp. Sorry, I forgot to mention. I went to the transverse colon and saw a 10 millimeter polyp that I resected with cold snare. Polyp is out. As I mentioned earlier, in the sigmoid colon, a 5 millimeter and 10 millimeter polyp resecting with a cold snare and retrieved. In the sigmoid colon, I'm seeing two tattoos. I don't see any scar from prior polypectomy. I see some pancolonic diverticulosis. Yeah, so it looks like we're going to have a good day, I think. I really hope so. So this procedure went well. Excellent. Okay, scope is... I'm withdrawing the scope completely out. Scope is out. There were no complications during the procedure. End of procedure 10, test 16."
24," Hi, today is 14 September 2024. This is test 24. We have a 65-year-old female with a history of weight loss and abdominal pain. Came here for colonoscopy for screening of colorectal cancer. Is she ready? Is she asleep? Okay, perfect. Now I'm beginning the procedure. Actually, can I have the head of the bed lowered, please? Thank you so much. I'm inserting the scope through the anus, carefully advancing through the rectum, and passing the scope into the sigmoid colon, moving towards the descending colon, moving further into the transverse colon, now into the ascending colon. The Boston bowel prep score is assessed along the way. Overall prep quality is adequate. The score in each segment is a 3 on the right colon, transverse colon, transverse colon is 3, and left colon is 3. Total score of 9. Advancing into the terminal ileum. Actually, I am unable to advance into the terminal ileum. I'm not going to actually do that. Never mind. I'm not advancing into the terminal ileum. I do identify this ileocecal valve, and the pendyceal orifice. I'm withdrawing my scope. So what are you planning to do after fellowship? Have you figured out your jobs yet? Oh, I see a polyp. It's maybe 8 millimeters. Actually, it's 6 millimeters. 6 millimeters sessile polyp. Uh, class, uh, Paris, uh, 0, 1, S, Nice, 1 in the ascending colon. Uh, I see it has surface features suspicious for adenoma, um, versus, uh, sessile. Actually, it's not suspicious for sessile. It's suspicious for adenoma versus inflammatory polyp. That's what I would say. I'm resecting the polyp with a cold snare. Can I have a cold snare? Please? Thank you. Resection is complete. The other parts of the colon seem to be normal. So, yeah, you know, when you interview for jobs, you have to just be very careful to ask the right things, etc. Yeah, I know. Yep. Um, I'm withdrawing the scope. I'm retroflexing. It appears to be normal. Um, don't forget to, um, pass by the doctor's lounge on the way out for doctor's day. Yeah. Okay. I'm withdrawing the scope completely out of the body. The scope is out. There were no complications during the procedure. End of procedure test 24."
23," This is test 23. Today is 14th September 2024. We have a 65-year-old female for assessment of colorectal cancer. Her last colonoscopy procedure is unknown. I'm beginning the procedure. Inserting the scope through the anus, I'm carefully advancing through the rectum. I'm continuing toward the sigmoid colon, now passing the descending colon. Moving further, I see the transverse colon, then the ascending colon. The Boston bowel prep score is assessed along the way. The overall prep quality is adequate. The score in the right colon is 2. Never mind, it is 3. The transverse colon is 3 and the left colon is 3. The total score is 9. Yes, come on in. What's going on? What's going on? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Just tell them that I'll come out and speak with them soon, okay? Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Thank you so much. Okay, can I, um, please have a piece of gauze? Thank you so much. The colon has a distal attachment. In the cecum, I see the appendiceal orifice and ileocecal. I see the appendiceal orifice and ileocecal valve. I'm withdrawing the scope. The colon looks normal. Um, uh, yeah, we have a trip planned, actually, to Portugal coming up. Mm-hmm. We're very excited about it. Yeah, we are. Yep. Yep. Um, it looks like there's a polyp here. Actually, you know what? This is not a polyp. This is not a polyp. My bad. Okay. Is that a diverticulum? No. No, there's no diverticulum, actually, either. Okay. Um, can I have some more lubricant, please? Okay. Thank you. Um. Yeah. Yeah, I heard there's free lunch today. What is it? Where'd you get it from? Greek. That's good. I really like Greek food. Okay. Okay. All right. Can you turn the screen for me as well, please? I just can't see very well for some reason. Thank you. Okay. Everything looks normal. Um, retroflexion. I don't see any pathology on retroflexion. I'm removing the scope completely out of the body. Scope out. There were no complications during the procedure. This is the end of procedure test 23."
20," Hi, good morning. This is test 20. Today is the 14th of September, 2024. We have a 65-year-old female who's come here for a colonoscopy for a history of colon polyps. Her last procedure was on July 2021. I'm beginning the procedure. Can I please have some more lubricant, please? Thank you very much. I'm inserting the scope through the anus, now entering the rectum, moving towards the sigmoid. I'm carefully advancing through the descending colon, moving further to the transverse colon. Now I've reached the ascending colon. Now I'm advancing through the cecum. Um, this is a tough one, actually. I'm having a hard time with this. Um, can I, um, please get some sigmoid pressure? Thank you, thank you. Um, yeah. How's everything going out there? Good? Did you figure out the consent thing? Okay. Okay. Good. Um. The Boston bowel prep score, let's see here. The right colon is 3, transverse colon is 3, left colon is 1. No, wait, sorry. The left colon is actually 3 after some cleaning. Total score of 9. The colonoscope is with a distal cap attachment. Now I'm advancing to the terminal ileum. Um, okay. Okay. I see a punctate erosion in the terminal ileum. Can I have biopsy forceps, please? Yes, please. Now I'm doing a targeted biopsy. Biopsy is complete. Yeah, is your house back on the real estate market? It is. It's a tough market these days, yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. Um, the terminal ileum has, is this something? Does it have an ulcer? No, no. The terminal ileum has no other evidence of lesions other than the punctate erosion. Uh, it appears normal. I'm, uh, gonna withdraw the scope. Um. I see a scar with some evidence of recurrent polypoid tissue. Okay. Actually, I'm sorry. There is no evidence of recurrent polypoid tissue. Um, and I see a tattoo in the proximal ascending colon. Um. Yeah, so what have you considered? Like, you're gonna rent? What are you gonna do with that? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. I see. Okay. Okay. So as I said, I see a tattoo in the proximal. Uh, sorry. Proximal ascending colon. I'm withdrawing the scope. The other parts of the colon look normal. I'm withdrawing the scope completely out of the body. Scope is out.
