16," This is test 16. We have a 65-year-old female who's coming for colonoscopy for personal history of colon polyps. Her last colonoscopy was performed a year ago. I'm beginning the procedure now. I'm inserting the scope through the anus. The scope is in. Carefully advancing through the rectum. Is he oxygenating well? Everything's going okay? Okay, that's good, that's good. Do you need me to move anything here with the oxygen mask? No. Okay, that sounds good. So continuing to pass through the sigmoid, going through the descending colon. Now we're in the transverse colon. Continuing towards the ascending colon. We are in the ascending colon. Pamela, did you end up cooking that turkey roast for everybody? Oh, that's amazing. That's wonderful. Hope you guys enjoyed it. Great. The Boston Bow Prep score is being assessed along the way. The overall quality is adequate. The Boston Bow Prep score in the right colon is three. Transverse colon is one. no wait sorry 3 transverse colon is 3 left colon is 3 total score of 9 now we are in the cecum I see the appendiceal orifice and the ileocecal valve I see 5 polyps measuring from 3 to 13 mm in size all are Paris 0 to 1 S and Nice type 2. The 13 millimeter polyp, I'm using saline to demarcate and lift the lesion. Now I'm resecting the polyp. Polyp is resected. Can I please have the hot snare? Mm-hmm. Okay. Yep. Yep. Okay. Bring it down a little bit. Yep. okay can you just turn it around a little okay perfect so the polyp is resected using hot endoscopic causal resection it is polyp is out i'm removing the other polyps with cold snare all polyps are retrieved you have it right you do okay great now I'm withdrawing the scope in the ascending colon I see a 15 millimeter polyp and a five millimeter polyp actually sorry the 15 millimeter one is actually 10 millimeters on closer inspection um they're both uh paris uh zero to one s nice type two i'm using a cold snare to retrieve the polyp polyp is out now i'm withdrawing the scope are you going to the colon cancer awareness marathon this uh upcoming weekend yeah we're going to try to make it Now I'm in the sigmoid colon. I see a 5mm and a 10mm polyp. Sorry, I forgot to mention, I went to the transverse colon and saw a 10mm polyp that I resected with cold snare. Polyp is out. As I mentioned earlier, in the sigmoid colon, a 5mm and 10mm polyp resecting with a cold snare. and retrieved in the sigmoid colon. I'm seeing two tattoos. I don't see any scar from prior polypectomy. I see some pancolonic diverticulosis. Yeah, so it looks like we're going to have a good day, I think. I really hope so. So this procedure went well.

24," Hi, today is 14 September 2024. This is test 24. We have a 65-year-old female with a history of weight loss and abdominal pain. Came here for colonoscopy for screening of colorectal cancer. Is she ready? Is she asleep? Okay, perfect. Now I'm beginning the procedure. Actually, can I have the head of the bed lowered, please? Thank you so much. I'm inserting the scope through the anus, carefully advancing through the rectum, and passing the scope into the sigmoid colon, moving towards the descending colon, moving further into the transverse colon, now into the ascending colon. The Boston bowel prep score is assessed along the way. Overall prep quality is adequate. The score in each segment is a 3 on the right colon. Transverse colon is 3 and left colon is 3. Total score of 9. Advancing into the terminal ileum. Actually, I am unable to advance into the terminal ileum. I'm not going to actually do that. Never mind. I'm not advancing into the terminal ileum. I do identify this ileocecal valve and the penteceal orifice. I'm withdrawing my scope. So what are you planning to do after fellowship? Have you figured out your jobs yet? Oh, I see a polyp. It's maybe 8mm. Actually, it's 6mm. 6mm sessile polyp. Class Paris 01S Nice 1 in the ascending colon. I see it has surface features suspicious for adenoma versus sessile. Actually, it's not suspicious for sessile. it's suspicious for adenoma versus inflammatory polyp that's what i would say i'm resecting the polyp with a cold snare can i have a cold snare please thank you resection is complete the other parts of the colon seem to be normal so yeah you know when you interview for jobs you have to just be very careful to ask the right things, etc. Yeah, I know. Yep. I'm withdrawing the scope. I'm retroflexing. It appears to be normal. Don't forget to pass by the doctor's lounge on the way out for doctor's day. Yeah. Okay.

It's Paris LST GM0 2A plus 1S JNET classification 2A Okay Can I please get a hot snare? Okay, thank you so much. And lifting agent. Now I'm dissecting the lesion in a piecemeal fashion with endoscopic mucosal resection. I'm lifting the lesion, demarcating with a pre-mixed solution of heta starch. and methylene blue, and I'm using a 10 millimeter captivator snare. No, actually, sorry. No, yeah, it is 10 millimeter. I'm treating the resection is complete, and I'm treating the margin of the resected area using a snare soft tip coagulation. Now I'm closing the defect with two mantis clips.

I'm resecting this with a cold snare. Resection is completed. As I'm withdrawing, I'm in the recto sigmoid at 20 centimeters from the anal verge. I see a 20 millimeter pseudodepressed lateral splitting lesion. I'm attempting to lift this lesion with a pre-mixed solution of head of starch and methylene blue, but it's not lifting. I'm not able to lift the lesion. okay i'm taking a biopsy from the center of the lesion with the cold forceps and sending for this for histology i'm placing a tattoo two centimeter distal two on the opposite wall of the lesion I'm withdrawing the scope the scope is out there were no complications during the procedure this is the end of procedure test 11"
