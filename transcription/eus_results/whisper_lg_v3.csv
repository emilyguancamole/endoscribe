cancer05," This is Dr. Venkat Akshathala dictating the procedure for an upper endoscopic ultrasound without a finital aspiration performed on a female patient. Test 5, whose date of birth is the 20th of August 1981, with MRN 3446548. Right, the procedure is being done at the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center and today is the 2nd of January, 2025. The patient is a 60-year-old female who is undergoing pancreatic cancer surveillance due to a strong family history of pancreatic cancer. She's participating in the ongoing CAPS research study. So I'm using an Olympus GF-UCT180 echo endoscope today. We're now beginning the procedure and I'm now introducing the scope through the mouth into the esophagus. As I pass the scope through the esophagus, the mucosa appears to be normal and there seems to be no erosion, stricture, or some masses. Now on the stomach, there seems to be a moderate amount of retained thick liquid with particulate material that's seen. This is despite overnight fasting. The gastric mucosa otherwise appears to be normal and there seems to be no ulcers, nautilarities or visible lesions. I'm continuing to advance into the duodenum. I'm now in the first part, advancing to the second portion of the duodenum. The mucosa appears normal here. There seems to be no erythema, villus, blunting or matched lesions. I'm now visualizing the pancreas. I'm beginning at the head and tracing it to tail. The pancreas exhibits a diffuse hyper-echoic focal end strands but there seems to be no discrete masses. There seems to be diffuse lobularity throughout the pancreas but it doesn't really meet the criteria for chronic pancreatitis. The tail appears fatty with a consistent focal fat infiltration. The main pancreatic duct is normal in caliber with no echogenic duct wall thickening, there's no stricture stones or mural nodules. I'm visualizing the biliary tree and the common bile duct appears to be normal, there's no dilation stones or wall thickening and measures about 4.5 millimeters and appears to be normal. The liver, I'm visualizing the liver and appears to be normal as well, there's no focal lesions or any suspicious findings. There's no peripancreatic, perigastric or celiac axis lymph nodes that can be visualized. As part of the CAPS study protocol, I'm I'm collecting diurnal secretions adjacent to the normal appearing major papilla. That is the end and I'm now withdrawing the scope and re-polluting the structures on my way back. They all appear to be normal. This is where I feel there is bleeding or immediate complications. The scope is out. The patient appears to be stable. There seems to be very minimal blood loss. This is the end of the procedure."
cancer10," This is Dr. Bankadak Chantala and we're dictating the procedure for an upper endoscopic ultrasound without final aspiration. Performed on a male patient, test 10, whose date of birth is the 28th of August, 1981. The medical record number for this patient is 3446548. The procedure is being conducted at the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center and today is the 2nd of January 2025. The patient is a 74 year old male who's undergoing pancreatic cancer surveillance due to a personal history of BRCA1 gene mutation. His last EOS was in 2022 on the 14th of December which showed multiple pancreatic cysts in the head, body and tail including a 6mm septated pancreatic body cyst and a 7mm unilocular pancreatic tail cyst and a 3mm pancreatic head cyst. No higher features were identified the last time and the MPD appeared to be normal. A subsequent MRI on the next year on the 20th of December in 2023 demonstrated a normal pancreatic parenchyma with 3 cysts, two 11mm pancreatic tail cysts and 8-10mm pancreatic body cysts. The main pancreatic ducts remain normal in size with no dilated branches. We're using an Olympus GF-UCT180 echoendoscope today. I'm now commencing the procedure. I'm introducing the scope through the mouth and advancing it under direct visualization into the esophagus. Passing the scope through the esophagus and the mucosa appears to be normal. There seems to be no evidence of erosion, strictures, or masses. I am now on the stomach and the gastric mucosa appears to be normal with no ulcers, nodularity or abnormalities of any kind. I am now continuing to advance it into the first and second portions of the urinary tract. I am here in the urinary tract and the mucosa appears to be normal. I can't see any erythema, just blunting and haste. I'm now evaluating the pancreas and the surrounding structures. I'm beginning to visualize the pancreas from the head and tracing to the tail. The pancreatic pancrema appears to be normal. I can't see any hyperaquatic focal stranding. No cysts, no masses. Can't see calcification or lobularity. No concerning pancreatic lesions that I can identify. The main pancreatic duct is normal in caliber. and caliber there's no echogenic duct wall thickening no strictures or stones inside the MPD there's no mural or ideals either the CBD appears to be normal it measures about 6.6 millimeters in diameter and I'm able to press it from the high end to the ampulla there's no wall thickening dilation neither there's no stones either Now, the gallbladder appears to be normal. There's no peripalatistic fluids, stones or wall figment. No peripanthroic, perigastric or coelacus lymph nodes that I could see. Can't visualize any ascites or nodular deposits either. The peritoneum. The visualized portions of the liver are normal. There are no focal lesions or suspicious findings of any kind. The adrenal gland that I'm seeing here, the left adrenal gland appears to be normal. As part of the CAP study protocol, I'm collecting adrenal secretions from the... With the anendoscope position adjacent to the normal period major. I'm beginning withdrawal of the endoscope, now retracting it. On my way back, I'm revaluating the previously visual structures. On withdrawal, I'm not able to find any other abnormalities other than the ones I've already mentioned. There's no evidence of bleeding. The scope is out. it appears to be no complications and the patient appears to be stable. The estimated blood loss is minimal. This is the end of procedure."

The gastric mucus appears to be normal. I'm now advancing the scope through the pylorus into the first portion of the duodenum. The mucus here appears to be normal as well. I'm now in the second portion of the duodenum and I'm positioning it adjacent to the ampulla for better optimal imaging of the pancreas. I'm beginning to systematically visualize the pancreas. The pancreas appears to be normal in general. And there seems to be no evidence of hyper-echoic foci stranding or lobularity. At the head, the main pancreatic duct measures about 1.3 millimeters. It doesn't appear to be dilated. There seems to be no abnormalities of any kind. No ductal wall thickening, mucinous stones. I'm advancing the scope slightly to evaluate the body of the pancreas. The main pancreatic duct here measures 1.7 mm and appears to be normal. I am retracting the scope to visualize the tail. The main PD in the tail measures about 0.9 mm. It tapers smoothly. There seems to be no dilation of abnormalities here. The entire duct can be traced from the ampulla and shows no evidence of any strictures, tones, thickening or masses. There are no dilated branch ducts or pancreatic cysts that I can identify. Since I'm here in the second portion of the diurnum, I'm visualizing the common bile duct. It appears to be normal. There seems to be no dilation. It's about 1.4 millimeters in diameter. As part of the CAP study protocol, I'm collecting secretions from the duodenum using the scope. While withdrawing the scope, I can see that the the stomach and the duodenum are normal and the esophagus is normal as well though I admit there's limited visualization. I am now withdrawing the scope. The scope is out. The procedure is now complete. There seems to be no immediate complications of any kind. The blood loss appears to be minimal.

We're here with a 62 year old female who's undergoing an endoscopic ultrasound as part of her pancreatic screening in the context of her BRCA1 mutation. The patient has no family history of pancreatic cancer adenoma sorry, pancreatic adenocarcinoma though her family history details are limited she is participating in the CAPS protocol with an MRCP that is pending we are now going to begin the procedure the patient is sedated and I am now introducing an echoendoscope through the patient's mouth the scope is being advanced under direct visualization advancing the scope through the esophagus the mucosa appears normal with no evidence of any kind of strictures, erosions or masses now passing the scope into the stomach the gastric mucosa appears to be normal there appears to be no ulcers, erosions or abnormalities of any other kind I'm advancing the scope through the pylorus and into the first portion of the duodenum. The mucus appears to be normal. I'm continuing to advance the scope into the second portion of the duodenum, positioning the endoscope adjacent to the ampulla for better imaging of the pancreas. I'm infusing water to provide a better interface for ionization imaging. I'm beginning to visualize the pancreas, beginning at the head. I'm able to trace the pancreas from the head all the way to the tail. I'm visualizing this from the second portion of the duodenum. The parenchyma of the head shows nonspecific hyperechoic focae and strands. The main pancreatic duct in the head measures about 2.2 mm and is not dilated. There appears to be no ductal thickening, mucin stones or masses or abnormalities of any other kind. I'm slightly retracting the scope to visualize the pancreatic neck. pancreatic duct here measures about 1.4 millimeter and appears to be normal. As I continue withdrawing the scope I'm assessing the pancreatic body. The duct here measures about 1.2 millimeters in this region and is normal. On further extraction of the scope I'm able to visualize the tail. The main pancreatic duct here in the tail measures about 0.8 millimeters. The panetaba continues to show hyper-echoic foci and strands, but there seem to be no concerning features like masses, frictions, or stones. Overall, the main panetaba ducts taper smoothly and no dilated branch ducts are identified. Since I'm here, I'm visualizing the common bile duct which measures about 2.9 mm in diameter.

cancer07," This is Dr. Mekatak Shantala dictating the procedure for an upper endoscopic ultrasound without finital aspiration performed on a male patient, test 7, whose date of birth is August 20th, 1981. The medical record number is 3446548. The procedure is being conducted at the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center. And today is the 2nd of January, 2025. The patient's a 70-year-old male who's undergoing pancreatic cancer surveillance due to a BRCA1 mutation. He has a family history of pancreatic cancer and a previously identified pancreatic cyst. He is participating in the ongoing cancer of the pancreas screening research study, the CAP study. I'm using an Olympus GIF HQ190 gastroscope today. I'm also using an Olympus GF-UCT180AOS ultrasound as well. I'm now introducing the gastroscope through the mouth and advancing it under direct visualization into the esophagus. In the esophagus I can see fine white exudates in the mid and the proximal esophagus. Suggestive of Candida infections. I'm obtaining biopsies for good measure. Otherwise, the mucosa appears normal and there were no strictures or masses or nodularities. As I advance the scope into the stomach, I'm able to observe the mucosa is variegated and it's kind of consistent with chronic gastritis. There are no ulcers or reductions of masses. biopsying the gastric antrum and body. I'm taking multiple biopsies here. I'm advancing the scope now into the duodenum. I'm in the first portion of the duodenum. Now entering the second portion of the duodenum. I'm able to see some mylarithema and edema in the duodenal bulb and in D2. I'm obtaining biopsies here as well. I'm now withdrawing the gastroscope and I'm now introducing the echoendoscope. Through the oesophagus, now in the stomach, now in the duodenum, now trying to visualize the pancreas. I'm beginning at the head and tracing it all the way to the tail. I'm able to see a single anechoic oval cyst with a septated component in the body of the pancreas. It measures about 9.8 millimeters in maximum diameter. I'm not able to see any mural nodules within the cyst. The cyst is communicating with the main pancreatic duct and it's likely a branch duct IPMN. The main pancreatic duct on the other hand is mildly dilated in the neck. It's about four millimeters and in the proximal body measures about 3.4 millimeters. It's pretty stable from the prior EOS. The duct is normal in the head It's also normal in the mid body and the distal body as well and the tail. There's no... I can't see any visibly obstructing lesions here. I can't see any pancreatic masses. I can't identify any masses in the pancreas. Anyway, moving to the biliary tree, I'm able to see that the common bile duct is normal. Can't see any stones or any other abnormalities. The CBT measures 4.1 millimeters. It's appearing pretty normal to me. I can't see any peripancreatic, perigastric or celiac axis lymph nodes. The ampulla appears normal. The gallbladder on the other hand seems to be some amount of micro-OTS or sludge that's present in the gallbladder. There's no perigallocystic fluid though, there's no wall thickening. The diurnal secretion on the other hand, I'm collecting it as part of the cap study protocol. Right so I'm now withdrawing the endoscope and on my way back I'm able to re-evaluate the structures and they all seem there's nothing different from from before. There's no evidence of bleeding. I'm withdrawing the scope. The scope is out. The patient appears to be stable. There seem to be no immediate complications whatsoever. This is the end of the procedure."
cancer09," This is Dr. Venkatakshanthala dictating a procedure for an upper endoscopic ultrasound without fine needle aspiration performed on a male patient. Test line, whose date of birth is the 20th of August, 1981. The medical record number is 3446548. Today is the 2nd of January 2025 and we are here at the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center with a 60 year old male who is undergoing pancreatic cancer surveillance due to a personal history of BRCA2 mutation. He also has a family history of pancreatic cancer and a previously identified indeterminate focal pancreatic abnormality in the tail of the pancreas. He's participating in the ongoing cancer of the pancreas screening research study, the CAPS study. His last EUS, I think, was in 2022, on the 30th of November, 2022. It showed a focal area of hypoechogenic lobularity in the tail of the pancreas that measured 17.4 millimeters without a discrete mass. The U.S. also found that the pancreas had fatty infiltration and there was echogenic foci on posterior shadowing and stranding in the pancreatic parenchyma, but the MPE was known. Our MRI-MRCP on 14th of April 2023 showed a normal pancreas without any suspicious conditions. We're using an Olympus UCT180GF echo endoscope today. We're now commencing the procedure. I'm introducing the echo endoscope through the mouth and advancing it under direct visualization. I'm advancing the scope through the esophagus and I'm able to see that the mucus appears normal. There's no evidence of erosion, strictures, or masses. As I advance the scope into the stomach, I'm able to see that the gastric mucosa appears to be normal. There seems to be no evidence of ulcers, nodularities, or any other abnormalities. I'm now advancing the scope into the diurnum. I'm through the first portion and the second portion of the diurnum. So far, the diurnum appears to be normal. I can't see any erythema or mass lesions or any of the rest. I'm now able to visualize the pancreas. I'm beginning at the head and tracing it to the tail. I can see a focal area of heterogeneous lobularity at the tail of the pancreas. I can't see any masses though. It's without a discrete mass. The appearance remains stable when compared to prior imaging. The pancreatic pattern came out the way it appears to be normal, with evidence of fatty infiltration, echogenic focal inch failure. The MPD is now dilated. It measures 2 mm at the head and 1.7 mm at the tail, near the focal area of hypoechogenicity. I can trace a duct to the ampulla in D1 and D2. It's with a smooth taper and there's no evidence of thickening stones, mucin masses or structures. I can't see any dilated branch ducts either. I'm able to see the common bile duct. It appears to be normal in caliber and appearance. There's no evidence of dilation, stones or wall thickening. The gallbladder appears to be normal. There's no evidence of wall thickening. I can't see any stones or any pericholecystic fluid either. There's no peripancreatic, perigastric or celiac axis lymph nodes. I can't visualize any of them. I can't see any ascites or notary deposits either. I'm now visualizing the liver. it appears to be normal. I can't see any focal lesions or suspicious findings. The left adrenal gland appears to be normal as well. As part of the CAP study protocol, I'm collecting diurnal secretion from the diurnum with the endoscope position adjacent to the normal appeared major cochlea. I'm now commencing withdrawal of the scope. On my way back I'm reevaluating all the structures. On withdrawal I'm able to see, I can't see any other abnormalities other than the ones I've already mentioned. There appears to be no evidence of bleeding of any kind. The scope is out. There seems to be no immediate complications. The patient appears to be stable. The smear blood loss has been made. This is the end of procedure."
cancer04," This is Dr. Venkat Akshantala dictating the procedure for an upper endoscopic ultrasound with a final aspiration on a female patient, test 4, whose date of birth is the 20th of August 1981 and MRN is 3446548. The procedure today is being done at Johns Hopkins Baby Medical Center and today is the second of January, 2025. The patient is a 58-year-old female who is undergoing baseline pancreatic cancer surveillance due to an APC mutation and a family history of pancreatic cancer. She is actually participating in the ongoing cancer pancreas screening research study, the CAPT study. So we are now beginning the procedure. We are using a HQ190 Olympus GIF gastroscope today. Let's go please. I'm beginning the procedure and I'm now introducing the scope and advancing it under direct visualization. um as i pass the scope through these figures uh the mucus appears normal with no evidence of erosions strictures or masses right so uh the the mucus appears normal with no erosion strictures and masses in the esophagus. As I advance the scope into the stomach I can see that the gastric mucosa appears to be normal with no evidence of erosion or ulcers, nodularities or any other abnormalities. I'm continuing to advance it into the first and second portion of the duodenum. While the mucus appears normal, there seems to be no edithema, there's no villus blunting, no mastilations either. Right, so now I'm withdrawing the gastroscope now and I'm introducing the echoendoscope to the patient's mouth. It's an Olympus UCT 180GF echo endoscope. The mucosa in the esophagus appears normal. As I'm advancing the scope in the stomach, that appears normal as well. I'm now in the diurnum, the second portion of the diurnum. I'm beginning to visualize the pancreas. I'm beginning to visualize the head and I'm tracing to the tail. The pancreas appears to be normal with scattered echogenic foci and strands, but without any lobularity. There seems to be no calcifications or changes of chronic pancreatitis as well. The main pancreatic duct is normal in caliber and is traced from the head to the ampulla. There's no echogenic duct wall, thickening, there's no structures, I can't see any stones or mural nodules, I can't see any pancreatic masses or cysts. I can't identify any mural nodules or cysts as well. The common bile duct appears to be normal. There seems to be no dilations. There's no stones or abnormalities either. Now I'm visualizing the liver. That appears to be normal. There's no focal lesions or suspicious findings. I'm visualizing the lymph nodes. I'm able to see a few subcentimeter peripatriatic and perigastric lymph nodes. They appear to be benign, heterogeneous, and predominantly hyper-echoic. No coeliac axis lymphadenopathy is seen though. There's no ascites or nodular peritoneal deposits. As part of the CAPS protocol, I'm collecting diurnal secretions with an echo-endoscope adjacent to the normal appearing major papilla. I'm now beginning withdrawal of the scope. I'm also re-evaluating the structures on my way back. On withdrawal, they all appear normal. There's no evidence of bleeding. There seems to be no immediate complications as well. The scope is out. The patient appears to be stable. There's no immediate complications. The procedure is complete. This is the end of procedure."
cancer03," This is Dr. Venkatesh Muthala, detailing the procedure for an upper endoscopic ultrasound without finital aspiration and an esophageal gastro- duodenoscopy with biopsy performed on a female patient, test free, who with the date of birth of August 20th, 1981, and the medical record number is 3446548. Today is the 2nd of January 2025, here at Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center. This is a 50 year old female who's undergoing high risk pancreatic cancer surveillance due to a family history of pancreatic cancer. Her father had pancreatic cancer. Her last EUS was performed in 2021, I think in July, where a four millimeter pancreatic cyst was identified and an MRI abdomen on 10th of July 2024 showed a hyper-intense lesion in the pancreatic tail that measured about 8 mm and an exophytic lesion from the pancreatic body that measured about 9 mm, both of which have remained unchanged and do not enhance. No variant of the anatomy was noted. Additional findings included fatty infiltration of the liver and cholelithiasis. So we are now beginning the procedure. I'm using an Olympus GIF HQ 190 gastroscope today. So advancing the gastroscope to the mouth and advancing it under direct visualization. As I pass the scope through the esophagus, I can see that the mucus appears normal, it's approximately normal. The GE junction is about 40 cm from the incisors. In the distal oesophagus, a lagrid B oesophagitis is present. It's characterized with mucosal breaks that extend about two or more mucosal folds. No births, oesophagus, no nodularity, no masses. I'm advancing the scope in the stomach. The mucus appears normal. obtaining biopsy for good measures from the gastric body and the antrum to multifunctionally evaluate for H. pylori infection. As I advance the scope further into the first and the second parts of the duodenum, I can see that the mucus appears normal. There seems to be no evidence of any inflammation, nodularity, or other abnormalities. I'm now withdrawing the gastroscope I'm now introducing an echo endoscope using an Olympus GDF UCT 180. I'm re-valuating the mucosa and the esophagus. I'm just able to see a leg rabies of esophagitis distally. The stomach appears normal. The duodenum appears normal as well. And now I'm beginning to visualize the pancreas. I'm beginning from the head and tracing to the tail. The parenchyma appears myelolabular in the pancreatic body with some amount of stranding and myelofatty infiltration. The main pancreatic duct is not dilated and can be traced from the head to the ampulla. It measures about 2.5 millimeters in the head, about 1.4 millimeters in the neck and about 1 millimeter in the body. It tapers smoothly without any wall thickening musings or strictures or there are no stones present or masses there doesn't seem to be any dilated branch ducts either I can't see any of those I can't find two pancreatic lesions though that's about a five millimeter well-defined single single chambered anechoic thin wall cysts in the body of the pancreas. No septations, no mural nodules, no calcifications of any kind. There's no obvious communication with the pancreatic duct either. Another pancreatic lesion is about 4.5 millimeters in diameter. It's heterogeneous. It's a hyperechoic lesion and it's in the distal pancreatic body. It's concerning for a peripancreatic lymph node versus a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. Now I'm visualizing the bile duct. I can trace it. It appears normal. There seems to be no dilations, tones, or abnormalities. It's about 3.3 mm in caliber. The gallbladder is normal in size and shape. There's some amount of cholelithiasis. There's no wall thickening or pericholecystic fluid that's present. A small 11.4 mm peripatriatic lymph node can be identified. There's no other lymphadenopathy of any kind. I'm scanning the peritoneum now. Moving here, there's no ascites or nautilar deposits. Visualizing the pancreas, it appears normal, there's no suspicious vision or focal abnormalities. Seeing the adrenal gland now, and that appears normal as well. As part of the CAHPS protocol, I'm collecting urinal secretions with the scope positioned close to the... adjacent to the normal appearing major papilla. I'm now carefully withdrawing the scope, revaluating the structures on my way back. There seems to be no evidence of any abnormalities here, other than the ones that I previously spoke about. There's no evidence of bleeding either. The scope is out. There seems to be no immediate complications. This is the end of the procedure and yeah the blood loss appears to be minimal as well."

The procedure is being conducted at the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center and today is the second of January, 2025. The patient is a 54 year old female who's undergoing pancreatic cancer surveillance as a BRCA2 mutation carrier. She has no family history of pancreatic cancer and is participating in the ongoing cancer for cancer of the pancreas screening research study, So, we're going to begin the procedure now. We're using an Olympus GF-UCT180 echoendoscope today. I'm now introducing the endoscope through the mouth and advancing it under direct visualization. As I pass the scope through the esophagus, the mucus appears normal with no evidence of erosion stricture of the masses. Advanced scopin to the stomach. The gastric mucus appears normal. There are no ulcers, nodularity or any other abnormalities. As I can hear advancing the scopin to the first and second portion of the diurnum. The mucus appears normal here without any erythema, villus blunting or mast lesions. I'm now positioning the scope in the second portion of the duodenum to perform an evaluation of the pancreas and the surrounding structures. I'm visualizing the pancreas beginning at the head and tracing it all the way to the tail. The parenchyma appears to be homogeneous and normal. There seems to be a small amount of minimal fat infiltration, but there's no changes at a suggestive chronic point of view. Coming to the main parenteral duct, it seems normal. It's normal in caliber. There's no echogenic duct wall thickening, there's no strictures, I can't see any stones, I can't see any mural nodules either. It measures about 2.8 mm at the head, and when you measure it at the tail, it's about 1.7 mm. I can't see any masses or cysts in the pancreas. I'm not visualizing the liver and it appears to be normal. There seems to be no focal lesions or any other suspicious findings. There are no peripatiatric, celiac, axis or perigastric lymph nodes that can be visualized. See the gallbladder and there seems to be no gallbladder which is consistent with the history of prior cholecystectomy. There's no ascites or nodular peritoneal deposits. As part of the CAP study protocol, I'm now collecting diurnal secretions adjacent to the normal appearing 85-kilogram. I'm now beginning withdrawal of the scope. I'm now revaluating the structures on my way back. There seems to be no evidence of bleeding. There are no other abnormalities as far as I can see. The scope is out. The patient appears stable. There seems to be no immediate complications whatsoever. This is the end of the procedure. Assumption of bed loss is almost nil. End of procedure."

The procedure is being conducted at the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center, and today is the 17th of January, 2025. The patient is a 62-year-old female who is presenting for evaluation of GERD and an incidentally discovered pancreatic head cyst on previous imaging. We're using the EG29I10 and EG34J10U endoscopes. We are now commencing the procedure. I am now introducing the high def endoscope through the mouth and advancing it under direct visualization. As I pass the scope through the esophagus, I can observe a LA grade C esophagitis with mucosal breaks involving more than 75% of the circumference but I can't see any deep alterations. It's involving 75% of the circumference but without deep alterations. There's also a 2 cm high atrial hernia. It could be classified as a Hill Grade 3. There's no proximal inlet patch that I can see. The esophageal mucus otherwise appears to be normal with no nodularity, strictures, or masses. I'm biopsying the mid and the proximal esophagus to rule out eosinophilic esophageitis. The gastroesophageal junction is noted at 33 centimeters from the incisors with a diaphragm pinch noted at 35 centimeters. I'm now advancing the scope into the stomach. The gastric mucosa appears to be normal with no ulcers, erosions, or mast lesions. I'm taking random biopsies here to rule out Helicobacter pylori infections. I'm now continuing to advance the scope into the first and second portions of the duodenum, where the mucosa appears to be normal here without any erythema, ulcerations, or villous blunting. I'm now drawing the gastroscope and introducing the echo-endoscope for the patient's mouth. I'm now passing through the esophagus. the mucosa remains unchanged from prior evaluation, just the L.A. grits and esophageal is that can be noted. The scope is advanced in the stomach, and I'm now pushing the endoscope in the second portion of the diodium to visualize the pancreas, beginning at the head, and I'm trying to trace it to the tail. The pancreatic parenchyma appears to be homogeneous with mild diffuse fatty infiltration. A cystic complex can be seen in the head of the pancreas with a large cystic component measuring 29.6 mm x 19.9 mm. The cyst has no mural nodules, no gasification and no obvious connection with the main branch of the adduct. I'm using a 22 gauge aspiration needle to perform FNA. I can confirm using color Doppler that no intervening vascular structures are present. before beginning the puncture. Beginning the first pass, I'm able to obtain about 60 c of clear viscous fluid that I've aspirated. Oh, two grams of IV of cefetetan was administered prior to the puncture, for good measure for infection prophylaxis. The main pentatonic duct appears to be normal and measures about 3.0 mm in the head and 1.3 mm in the body and 0.6 mm in the tail. I'm now visualizing the biliary tree. I can see that the common bile duct is now dilated and it measures about 5.1 mm just below the hilum with no stone strictures or abnormalities. The gallbladder appears normal but I can see some microlithiasis without mural thickening or pericordial cystic fluid. No peripancreatic, periportal or coelac access lymph nodes can be visualized. Now I'm visualizing the liver and the portions that I'm visualizing in the liver demonstrate a hepatic steatosis with mild blunting of the liver edge. There are no mass lesions or intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation. I can't see any ascites or nodular deposits either. I'm beginning withdrawal of the scope and re-evaluating the visualized structures on withdrawal. Withdrawal is almost complete and there's no evidence of bleeding. Withdrawal is now complete. There's no immediate complications. The patient appears to be stable. The estimated blood loss is none. This is the end of procedure."
cyst10," This is Dr. Venkatakshan Thala, detailing the procedure for an operandoscopic ultrasound with fine needle aspiration and needle-based confocal laser endomicroscopy performed on a female patient. Test 10 with date of birth of August 20, 1981 and medical record number 3446548. The procedure is being conducted at the Johns Hopkins Baby Medical Center on January 17th of 2025. That's today And we're here with a 61-year-old female patient Who's presenting for surveillance of a pancreatic head Or uncinate cyst She previously underwent an EUS on 27th of January in 2023 Which demonstrated a 0.7 cm cyst in the pancreatic body and a 5.4 x 3.7 cm cyst in the pancreatic head or incident process with a mixed macro-microcystic appearance, which was suggestive of a serious cystadenoma. EOSFNA performed at the time was negative for CEA and cytologists showed a mucin. Given these findings, the cyst was likely consistent with a serious cystadenoma. The patient is returning today for ongoing surveillance. so I'm now commencing the procedure I'm using a Olympus GF-UC-T180 ultrasound US ultrasound sorry I'm introducing the scope through the mouth and advancing it under direct visualization into the esophagus the mucus here appears to be normal with no erosions or strictures that I can identify as I advance the scope into the stomach it appears to be normal I can't see any ulcers or erosions or mass lesions. I continue advancing the scope into the first and second portion of the diadenome, where the mucous appears to be normal, without any erythema, villus, blunting, or ulcerations. I'm pushing the scope in the second portion of the diadenome to perform a systematic evaluation of the pancreas and the surrounding structures. I'm visualizing the pancreas beginning at the head and tracing it to the tail. The pancreatic pancrema shows my lobularity and fatty infiltration, particularly in the pancreatic body and tail. I can note some amount of echogenic phoca and stranding. The main pancreatic duct is not dilated, measures about 2.2 millimeters in the neck and 1.4 millimeters in the body. The duct can be traced to the ampulla and shows a smooth taper with no evidence of echogenic duct wall thickening. There are no strictures or stones in the duct, no masses or no mass lesion or mucin either. I can't visualize any dilated branch ducts. I can see a 48.7 millimeter across 49.2 millimeter lesion in the pancreatic head or uncinebrosis. The lesion has a primarily microcystic appearance with some macrocystic components. Thin walls seem to separate the compartments with no evidence of calcification. or a central scar. There's no direct communication of the main pancreatic duct that I can observe. I'm beginning the final aspiration. I'm using a 19-gauge expect needle. I'm using color Doppler to confirm the absence of intervening vascular structures. I'm in. I only performed a single pass. Antibiotics were administered before the puncture for infection prophylaxis. NCLE is being performed now. I administered a 5-amyl of fluorescein dye before the NCLE. On NCLE, no epithelial structures or papillary projection can be visualized. Fine capillaries with a foreign pattern are noted. This is consistent with a serous cystadenoma. I'm visualizing the biliary tree. the common bile duct appears to be normal in caliber and appearance. There's no stones or stitches. There appear to be no peripancreatic, perigastric, or celiac axis lymph nodes that can be visualized. I'm visualizing the liver, and the visualized portion of the liver appear to be normal, with no focal lesions or abnormalities. The adrenal gland is what I'm seeing now, and the left adrenal gland appears to be normal. I'm beginning withdrawal of the scope now. I'm revaluating all the previously visualized structures on my way back. On withdrawal, there appear to be no other abnormalities than the ones I previously mentioned. There appears to be no evidence of bleeding. The scope is out. The patient appears to be stable. There appears to be no immediate complications. The estimated blood loss is minimal. And this is the end of the procedure."

She has no prior history of pancreatic disease, no family history of pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer. She has no prior history of weight loss, nausea, vomiting, fears, or chills. She's a non-smoker, consumes alcohol in moderation. A prior CD that was performed on the 3rd of November in 2024 showed a very small hypotense lesions in the pancreatic body with a normal pancreatic duct. The patient's undergoing EUS for further evaluation of a pancreatic cyst along with a colonoscopy for colon cancer screening. I'm introducing the pediatric colonoscope and advancing it through to the diadenome. As I pass the scope through the esophagus, the mucosa appears to be normal. there appears to be no strictures nor dilarity of erosions. I'm in the stomach now which appears to be normal there seem to be no ulcers, erosions or mast lesions. As I continue advancing it into the first and second portion of the diadenome where the mucus appears to be normal without erythema, villus blunting or ulcerations. I'm now introducing the Olympus PCFH190DL endoscope. And I'm now in the esophagus. The mucosa remains unchanged from prior evaluation. I'm advancing the scope into the stomach and I'm now pushing the scope in the second portion of the diatom to perform a systematic evaluation of the pancreas and the serotonin structures. I'm beginning the evaluation of the pancreas at the head and tracing into the tail. The pancreatic parenchyma appears to be normal with no evidence of mast lesions, hyper-echoic focal strands or calcifications.

The duct is traced to the ampulla and can be traced to the ampulla and shows a smooth taper with no evidence of echogenic duct wall thickening, mucin, mass lesions, strictures or stones. No dilator branch ducts can be visualized though I can see three pancreatic cysts in the neck of the body. So the first pancreatic cyst in the neck measures about 3.7 millimeters. It's definitely single chambered. It's thin walled without septation, some mural nodules. No calcifications and has communication with the main pancreatic duct. The second cyst in the body, the pancreatic body cyst, sorry the pancreatic body, the first pancreatic body cyst, and the second cyst in general, it measures about 3.3 millimeters, is well defined, single chambered thin walled without septation of mural nodules there's no obvious communication with the main pancreatic duct the second pancreatic body cyst and the third cyst in general overall measures about 2.7 millimeters across 6.7 millimeters it was well defined has two chambers separated by a thin septation the no mural nodules calcifications or connection to the main pancreatic duct I'm now visualizing the biliary tree the common bile duct appears to be normal in caliber and measures about 4.2 millimeters. I can't see any stricture stones or abnormalities. The gallbladder appears to be normal with no wall thickening stones or pericollis cystic fluid. I can't visualize any periparietic, perigastric or coelac axis lymph nodes. The visualized portions of the liver appear to be normal with no focal lesions or abnormalities.

The procedure is being conducted at the Johns Hopkins Oslo Center, and today is the 17th January 2025. The patient is a 70-80 year old female who is undergoing surveillance for multiple pancreatic cysts that were initially detected on a cardiac CT in December of 2020. Genetic testing was negative and she remains asymptomatic. The previous EOS in 2021 demonstrated multiple cysts including a 19 mm cysts in the body, a 21 x 4.9 mm cyst in the anterior process, a 9 mm cyst in the body, a 17 mm cyst in the tail, a 13 mm cyst in the neck, and a 11 mm cyst in the head with no pancreatic duct dilation. Her most recent MRI and MRCP was on 11th of October in 2023, which confirmed multiple pancreatic cysts without apparent nodular or enhancing features. with a serpaginous dilated duct in the uncinated process measuring about 8mm. Patient has declined EUSFNA unless worrisome features are detected. She is Ashkenazi Jewish with cholera of GD negative and a maternal first cousin with pancreatic cancer. She has declined participation in the CAP study. We're using an Olympus GF-UCT180 scope today. I'm advancing this scope under direct visualization after introducing it through the mask into the esophagus. As I pass the scope through the esophagus, the mucous appears to be normal with no strictures or erosion or nodularity. I'm advancing the scope into the stomach, which appears to be normal with no ulcers, erosions, or mastilations. I continue advancing the scope into the first and second portions of the diadenome, where the mucus appears to be normal, without erythema, villus, blunting, or ulcerations. I am now pushing the endoscope into the second portion of the diadenome to perform a systematic evaluation of the pancreas and the surrounding structures. Visualizing the pancreas, beginning at the head and tracing it to the tail, the pancreatic pancreatic parenchyma shows mild atrophy near the neck and the proximal body with focal fatty infiltration and lobularity, particularly in the pancreatic body. The main pancreatic duct is not dilated in the body and the tail but a few are somewhat dilated in the neck and head measuring 6.3 mm in the neck and 5.3 mm in the head. The duct is traced to the ampulla showing a smooth taper with no evidence of echogenic duct wall thickening. using mass lesions, strictures or stones. No dilated branch ducts can be visualized. Multiple pancreatic cysts can be identified throughout the pancreas. In the pancreatic tail, there are cysts that measure 3.3 millimeters, 3.1 millimeters, 8 millimeters, 20.8 millimeters, there's another one that measures 9.9 millimeters, and another one that measures 12.3 millimeters. All these cysts are well defined. They are single chambered, they are thin walled, without septation from neural nodules. There's a 14.3 mm pancreatic cyst in the neck of the pancreas, with a thin septum that's well defined. With a thin septum and the cyst is well defined without any neural nodules. The cyst in the pancreatic head measures about 5.3 mm, is single chambered, well defined, and is thin walled without mural nodules. I can't see any calcifications or any obvious communication with the main pancreatic duct in any of these cysts. I am now visualizing the biliary tree. The common bile duct appears to be normal in caliber and appearance, with no strictures or stones. The gall gland appears to be normal as well, with no wall thickening stones or pericollisistic fluid. There are no peripancreatic, perigastric or celiac axis lymph nodes that can be visualized any. I'm visualizing the liver now. The visualized portions of the liver appear to be normal, with no focal lesions or abnormalities. I can't see any ascites or nardula deposits. To me the left adrenal gland appears to be normal. I'm beginning withdrawal at the scope and I'm revaluating all the structures on my way back. On withdrawal, I'm unable to identify any other abnormalities other than the ones I've previously mentioned. Scope is out. There's no evidence of bleeding or any immediate complications. The patient appears to be stable. The estimated blood loss is minimal. This would be end of procedure."
cyst02," Today is the 17th of September 2024 and this is Dr. Venkatakshanthala dictating the procedure for an upper endoscopic ultrasound with fine needle aspiration with color Doppler. a male patient whose date of birth is August 20th 1981 with MR a number 666666 this is a 69 year old male patient pressing for an evaluation of a pancreatic cystic lesion the patient has a past significant past medical history of esophageal cancer left breast cancer and adrenal cortical adenoma and adrenal hyperplasia. Pancreatic protocol CT from December 30th 2023 revealed a 1.8 centimeter pancreatic body cyst with a questionable thin septation. The lesion has increased in size since 2019 and is suspected to be a side branch IPMN. We are now beginning the procedure. I am introducing the gastroscope. It's an Olympus GIF HQ190 gastroscope. I am introducing it through the mouth. I am advancing it through the esophagus and through the stomach. I am observing the lumen as I proceed. The esophageal mucus appear to be normal. There seems to be no evidence of inflammation. There seems to be no stricture of some masses. Being the stomach now, the gastric mucosa also appears to be unremarkable with no ulcers or erosions or masses of any kind. Now advancing into the duodenum. I'm in the second portion of the duodenum and I'm beginning to evaluate the pancreas using a linear echo-endoscope. the pancreatic parenchyma i'm evaluating it beginning with the head at the head of the pancreas it appears to be mildly lobular with echogenic foci and strands consistent with chronic changes the main pancreatic duct in the head measures about 1.3 millimeters it's not dilated. I'm able to see a cyst in the head and the uncinate region that's about 7 millimeters in size appears to be single chambered. It has thin walls there's no septation there are also no neural nodules and there appear to be no calcifications. There seems to be no evidence of communication between the cyst and the main pancreatic duct. I'm retracting the scope slightly to well with the pancreatic neck and body. The largest cyst seems pretty large this seems to be in the distal body of the pancreas. It measures about 23.7 millimeter across 13.8 millimeter. It's a multi-luculated cyst with thin septations and thin walls. There are no neural nodules or calcifications in the cyst. I am confirming with Doppler imaging and I can say that there are no intervening vascular structures. Using a 22 gauge fine needle, I am performing a single pass under real-time ultrasound guidance to aspirate fluid from the cyst. I'm able to aspirate about three millimeters. I'm sending this fluid over for molecular marker analysis, CEA and glucose anomalies level analysis as well. The cyst is not collapsing post-aspiration and about 8.3 mm residual portion remains. I'm further tracking the scope to evaluate the pancreatic tail. A single well-defined thin-walled cyst can be seen here. It's about 3.0 mm. There are no mural nodules or septations or calcifications of any kind. It doesn't seem to communicate with the main pancreatic duct. talking about the main pancreatic duct it can be traced from the head to the tail it's about 1.3 millimeters in the head it doesn't seem to be dilated measures about 2.5 millimeters in the neck and about 1.3 millimeters in the tail there seems to be no abnormalities of any kind in the pancreatic duct main pancreatic duct and there are no strictures, stones or thickening that can be identified. I am now visualizing the biliary tree and the common bile duct appears to be normal with no evidence of dilation, stones or wall thickening. It appears to be three millimeters in diameter. I am now withdrawing the endoscope. Under traction, the diodenum appears to be normal. I am re-evaluating the stomach as well. The gastric mucosa appears to be normal and so does the esophagus. There were no abnormalities of any kind noted in the visualized portions of the upper GI I'm now withdrawing the scope. The scope is out. There appear to be no immediate complications and the blood loss appears to be very minimal. This is the end of procedure."

The procedure was conducted on September 17, 2024 at the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center. The patient presented for evaluation of an incidentally detected pancreatic cyst noted on a CTA dated August 30, 2024. The imaging revealed a 1 cm subtle hyperdensity in the body of the pancreas and a possible 1.2 cm exophytic lesion in the head of the pancreas. A prior CT scan from July 27 of this year showed a mildly atrophic pancreas without ductal dilation, likely age-related. There is no history of any prior endoscopic ultrasound procedures. I'm today using a Olympus GF UCT 180 EUS curly linear ultrasound endoscope. Serial number is 713-5502. And I'm now beginning the procedure. The scope is in. I'm introducing it through the mouth and advancing it carefully through the esophagus now and i'm now in the stomach and into the second portion of the duodenum during advancement i observe the lumen and the surrounding structures and i can see that there are no abnormalities of any kind once the scope yeah the scope is now in the stomach and i'm infusing water I am using a 7.5 MHz frequency today for imaging of the pancreas and I am able to see multiple anechoic lesions consistent with pancreatic cysts. The largest cyst is in the proximal body around the neck of the pancreas and it measures about 1.1 cm x 0.65 cm. There appear to be no mural nodules or solid components within the cyst but I can see a thin septation. I am performing a fine needle aspiration using a 22 gauge FNAC is now complete. I'm using color Doppler to confirm that there are no intervening vascular structures prior to the puncture. FNAC was completed using a single pass. There seems to be minimal fluid but I'm sending it for molecular marker testing anyway. On the pancreas I can also see a 4.8 millimeter by 6.4 millimeter cyst in the pancreatic head. I'm able to see a cyst in the uncinate process as well. It measures about 8.6 millimeters by 9.6 millimeters. I'm also able to see another cyst in the pancreatic head that is about 8.7 millimeters cross 5.3 millimeters there seems to be a 1.5 millimeter septation within the cyst there seems to be a cluster of sub-centimeter cysts in the body the largest measures 6.2 millimeters cross 3.3 millimeters in the tail of the pancreas now there seems to be a 7.9 millimeter cyst The main pancreatic duct appears to be normal in diameter. It measures about 1.4 mm in the head, it's under 2 mm in the body and about 1 mm in the tail. There seems to be no evidence of duct wall thickening, there's no strictures, no stones, not any mural nodules.

The procedure is being conducted at the Johns Hopkins Baby Medical Center and today is the 17th of January 2025 and we're here with a 57-year-old male who's present for the surveillance of an incidentally detected pancreatic cyst on MRI. The patient has no family history of pancreatic cancer. After discussing the risk benefits and alternatives, informed consent was obtained. We're using a Olympus GFU CT 180 ultrasound. I'm passing the scope to the esophagus and commenting the procedure. As I introduce the scope through the mouth and advancing it under direct visualization and since I'm already in the esophagus, mucus appears to be normal. There are no strictures, nodularity, or erosions. I'm advancing the scope in the stomach. It appears to be normal. There are no ulcers, erosions, or mastitis. I'm continuing to advance the scope into the first and second portion of the diurnum, where the mucus is supposed to be normal, without erythema, villus, blunting, or ulcerations. I'm now pushing the scope into the second portion of the diurnum to perform a systematic evaluation of the pancreas and the surrounding structures, beginning at the head and tracing it to the tail. The pancreatic parenchyma shows scattered foci, strands, and myelobularity, but no discrete masses or calcifications or discrete mass stations. The main pancreatic duct is not dilated. It measures about 1.2 millimeters in the head, 0.8 millimeters in the body, and in the tail it measures about 0.7 millimeters. The duct, I'm tracing the duct to the ampulla. It shows a smooth taper with no evidence of echogenic duct wall thickening. There are no strictures or stones in the duct. There are no mass lesions I'm using either.

The pancreatic neck cyst measures 4.2 millimeters across 3.7 millimeters. It's well defined, single chambered, it's thin wall without Without any septation of the mural nodules, no calcifications and no communication with the main pancreatic duct. I am visualizing the biliary tree now. The common bile duct is normal in caliber measuring about 2.6 mm. No strictures, stones or abnormalities here. The gallbladder appears to be normal with no wall thickening, pericholecystic fluid or stones. There are no peripancreatic, perigastric or coelac axis lymph nodes that can be visualized. The visualized portion of the liver appear to be normal. There are no focal lesion or abnormalities. I'm beginning withdrawal of the scope, and I'm re-balloting all the structures on my way back. During withdrawal, there are no other abnormalities other than the ones that I've previously mentioned. There's no evidence of bleeding. The scope is out. the patient appears to be stable and there seem to be no immediate complications. The estimated blood loss is minimal and this is the end of the procedure."
cyst05," This is Dr. Venkatesh Chintala dictating the procedure for an upper endoscopic ultrasound with a fine needle aspiration and esophageal gastrodiagnoscopy. AGD performed on a male patient. Test phi due date of birth is the 20th of August 1981 and medical record number is 3446548. The procedure is being conducted at the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center on the 7th of January, 2025. The patient is a 71-year-old male who is presented for evaluation of pancreatic cysts. We are using an Olympus GFU CT180 and an Olympus GIFHT190 gastroscope today. Now commenting the procedure. I'm introducing the gastroscope to the mouth and advancing it under direct visualisation. As I pass the scope to the esophagus, I can see that the mucosa feels normal. I can't see any erosions, nodularies or strictures. I'm now advancing the scope in the stomach, where I can observe a bulge with erythema, likely from an adjacent pseudocyst. There is no evidence of active bleeding or alterations of mass solutions. I can hear advancing into the first and second portions of the duodenum, where the mucous appears normal without any of the immobility blunting or alterations. I am now withdrawing the gastroscope and introducing the endoscope. The mucous remains unchanged from prior evaluation in the oesophagus. As the scopus is being advanced into the stomach, there are no changes here as well, other than the previously mentioned abnormality. I'm now in the urethrum and I'm now beginning the distalizing pancreatics, beginning at the head and tracing to the tail. No pancreatic masses can be identified. The pancreatic parenchyma shows a few ectogenic foci and stranding, but otherwise it's unremarkable. The main pancreatic ducts of the MPD is not dilated and measures about 3 mm in the neck of the pancreas. The duct wall is not ectogenic and there are no dilated side branches. Parenchymal calcifications of the mammaries in the outer border of the MPD. There are no pancreatic calcifications or any other abnormalities on the border. I can see multiple pancreatic cysts which seems to be consistent with multifocal branched of IPMN. There is a pancreatic body cyst. The first pancreatic body cyst is about 29 millimeters in diameter with possible ductal communication. There seems to be some mucin debris and a hyper-echoic rim, but I can't see any solid nodules or any other concerning features. The second pancreatic body cyst is about 6 millimeters in length, also containing mucin debris with a hyper-echoic rim. The third pancreatic body cyst is about 4 millimeters in diameter. And as a pancreatic tail cyst at about 4.5 cm is well defined, filled with debris and likely is a pseudocyst. Now that I've identified the cyst, I'm beginning FNA using a 22 gauge needle. I'm beginning with the 29 mm pancreatic body cyst. I'm aspirating clear fluid from this. I only use a single pass. I'm now performing an FNA into the second pancreatic body cyst, the 6mm one. I'm aspirating clear fluid here as well, but it's only a relatively small amount of clear fluid. I'm now beginning FNA on the 4.5 cm system of pancreatic tail. Single pass and I'm able to aspirate debris through fluid. I'm now trying to visualize ability 3. I can trace the bile duct from the hilum to the ampulla. Ended up as normal in caliber with a thin duct wall and no dilation or stones or stitches. The gallbladder appears to be filled with microplasticity, but there's no sludge, urofibroma, or peripalasitic fluid. I'm able to visualize the left adrenal gland, and it appears to be normal. The visualized portions of the aria and the c-leg actus appear to be normal, with no aneurysms found by abnormal vascular structures. The left lobe of the liver that I'm able to visualize appears to be normal as well. There's no focal lesions or suspicious findings here. The visualized portions of the spin appear to be normal as well. I'm beginning withdrawal of the endoscope and I'm evaluating the previously visualized structures during withdrawal. There's no evidence of bleeding and the scope is out. There seem to be no immediate complications. The patient appears to be stable. The estimate of blood loss is minimal. This is the end of procedure."
mass05," This is test 5. Today is January 17th, 2025. Medical record number XYZ. I will be doing upper endoscopic ultrasound with fine needle aspiration color doppler. We have 78 year old male for the evaluation of pancreatic head mass. I'll be using Olympus GF-UCT180. I'm beginning the procedure. I am introducing a linear echo endoscope into the mouth now it's advancing through the esophagus now the stomach now I am in the second portion of the diurnal I I did not examine the upper jet tract in detail. Now I see a ill-defined hypoechoic solid mass in the head of pancreas. It is 20.2 x 19.6 mm in largest diameter. the endosodographic views are suboptimal due to the shadow exerted by the indwelling self-expandable metal state in the carbon bile duct i am doing fine needle biopsy of the mass i am using 22 got shark core needle using the slow pull technique. Now I am using color Doppler to confirm that there are no interwinding vascular structures. The biopsy specimen will be sent for on-site cytology evaluation and this confirms cellularity. Apart from the mass, the pancreatic pancrema appears normal with mild fatty infiltration but there is no lobularity, atrophy, calcification or irregular outer borders of the gland. I don't see any evidence of echogenic foci and stranding. The main pancreatic duct is not dilated and there is no evidence of echogenic duct wall, presence of mucin, mass or lesion or thickening or any store of strictures. The side branch is also not dilated. I see the bile duct has an indwelling metal biliary stent and the duct is completely collapsed over the stent. Now I see the gallbladder. The gallbladder is normal. I see two peripacriatic lymph nodes, bashing 14 mm and 12 mm, adjacent to the pancreatic head. As I'm moving towards the liver, I see the liver is normal. The peritorium has mild ascites. Now I'm withdrawing the scope. As a withdrawal you see the duodenum, the obseic, the stomach, now the esophagus, they all appear to be normal. Scope out. Estimated blood loss is minimal. All the specimens removed were sent for biopsy. Never do immediate complication. End of procedure, test 5."
mass03," Today is the 17th of September 2024 and we're here with a 70 year old male patient who's here presenting for an evaluation of a pancreatic mass. He initially presented with epigastric and back pain. A CT in CT abdomen pelvis that was performed of December in December of last year showed an infiltrative pancreatic mass that measured about 55 millimeters by 42 millimeters in the pancreatic body encasing the splenic artery and abutting the protoconfluence and major vessels. We're now beginning the procedure and I'm introducing the echo endoscopes to the patient's mouth and advancing it under direct visualization. As I pass the scope through the esophagus, the mucus appears normal. There seems to be no evidence of strictures, erosions, or masses. I'm now at the stomach. The gastric mucus appears normal. There seems to be no abnormalities of any kind. I'm proceeding to advance the scope through the pylorus and into the first and second portions of the diatom. The mucosa here appears normal as well. I'm now beginning to visualize the pancreas. I can see a heterogeneous hypoechoic mass in the pancreatic body that's extending into the pancreatic neck. The mass is about 52 mm by 40 mm and is abetting the portal confluence in the cilia and the c-lake takeoff. I can see that upstream to the mass that the main pancreatic duct is dilated and it measures about 8 mm in diameter. The pancrema here upstream to the mass appears to be atrophic as well. We're commencing the biopsy. I'm using a 22-gauge short-core fine needle. Okay, the IPv6 is complete. I performed three passes under ultrasound guidance and used color doppler as well. I've acquired adequate samples. Okay, now I'm able to see the bile duct. Visualizing the bile duct and it measures about 2.2 mm and 3.1 mm in caliper. Yeah, so the bile duct is within the pancreatic head and it measures 2.2 mm and the pancreatic head measures about 3.1 mm. There seems to be no abnormalities. The gallbladder appears to be normal as well. There seems to be no evidence of wall thickening stones or pericardial cystic fluid. I can see two peripancreatic lymph nodes adjacent to the pancreatic head. The first one measures 14 mm and the second one is 12 mm. I'm visualizing the liver now and shows no suspicious lesions or abnormalities of any kind. I'm withdrawing the scope and on withdrawal the visualized portions appear to be normal in the stomach and they seem to be normal in the esophagus as well. Scope is out. So far there seems to be no evidence of bleeding or any immediate complications. This is the end of procedure."
mass01," This is Dr. Venkatakshanthala detailing the procedure for an operandoscopic ultrasound with fine needle biopsy performed on a patient, testo 1, with a date of birth of August 20th 1981 and medical record number 3446548. The procedure is being conducted on 17th of September 2024 at the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center. The patient is a 63-year-old female who is presenting for an EOS for the evaluation of pancreatic head mass and a dilated pancreatic duct. She has undergone two prior EOS procedures with FNA on August 16, 2023 and in November of 2023, well, November 13, 2023, performed by an outside provider, both of which resulted in a non-diagnostic cytology. We are using the EG38J10UT echo endoscope today. We are now commencing the procedure. I'm introducing the endoscope through the mouth and advancing under direct visualization. I'm now in the esophagus. As I pass the scope through the esophagus, I can see that the mucus here appears to be normal. There's no strictures, nodularity, or erosions that I can see. I'm advancing the scope into the stomach now. And it appears to be normal here with no ulcers, erosions, or mass lesions. Continue to advance the scope into the first part of the diadenome. And now I'm in the second part of the diadenome. So far, the mucosa has appeared to be normal. There seems to be no erythema, with less blunting or alterations of any kind. I'm pushing the endoscope here, the second portion of the diurnum, to systematically evaluate the pancreas and the surrounding structures. I'm beginning to evaluate the pancreas at the head and tracing it to the tail. There's a partially circumscribed, circum... Yeah, so there's a 1.6 cm x 1.4 cm partially circumscribed isoechoic mass with a... papillary projections that can be seen at the ampulla and is obstructing the pancreatic duct. Upstream to the pancreatic duct dilation is noted and measures 9 to about 12 millimeters, tapering to 4.4 millimeters in the body. The duct is not visualized in the tail. There is a small 3.5mm x 4.6mm cyst communicating with the pancreatic duct that can be seen in the body. There are no concerning features. An additional intraductal filling defect can be observed in the pancreatic duct within the head but I am not biopsying this. But I am biopsying the ampullary mass using a 22 gauge short core needle. This is a final biopsy. I did a prologue for passes. There's an on-site cytotechnologist who's confirmed adequate cellularity. The findings are suspicious for a main duct interductor papillary mucinous neoplasm, an IPMN. I'm visualizing the biliary tree. The common bile duct is of normal caliber, measuring between 4.1 mm and 4.6 mm at the ampulla. There's no involvement of the bile duct by the intraductal pancreatic mass. I'm beginning withdrawal of the scope and I'm re-evaluating the visualized structures on withdrawal. On my way back, I can see that there are no other abnormalities other than the ones that I've previously mentioned. There seems to be no evidence of bleeding. I'm now withdrawing the scope. The scope is out. The patient appears to be stable. There seems to be no immediate complications. The estimated blood loss is minimal. And this is the end of procedure."

Today is the 17th of September 2024 and we are beginning the procedure at the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center. The patient is a 77 year old female who is presenting for an evaluation of a gastric fundus mass. She initially presented with dysphagia and abdominal pain. A priori GD on October 14th, 2023, showed a short skewed ingot which was dilated using a 54 French bougie. I believe there was a 2-3 cm subepithelial lesion with a central ulcer that was identified in the fundus. The lesion was firm on probing with biopsy forceps but no biopsies were performed at that time. I'm now introducing the gastroscope through the patient's mouth and I'm advancing it under direct visualization. We're using an Olympus HK 190 gastroscopic today. When entering the esophagus I can see that the uterus is normal. advancing the scope into the stomach and I can see the previously described gastric subepithelial lesion. It's along the higher left curve and anterior wall The lesion is approximately 2 cm. I'm performing bite-on-bite biopsies here. I'm advancing the scope further into the duodenum. The mucus appears normal without evidence of a mass, also other abnormalities. I'm withdrawing the gastroscope and I'm planning to introduce the endoscope next. Withdrawal is now complete. I'm now introducing the echo endoscope through the patient's mouth. I'm revaluating the esophagus. The mucus is normal. I'm now making my way to the stomach. On endoscopic ultrasound I can see that the lesion measures 27 millimeter by 14 millimeter. It appears heterogeneous and hypoechoic and is originating from the muscular sprochure. Within the lesion there's a small 7 centimeter by 7 centimeter anechoic area. I am using a 22 gauge Charcot needle to perform a fine needle biopsy. I've so far made three passes into the lesion. I used color Doppler before each pass. We are also using ROSE to confirm adequate cellular yield. On systematic evaluation of the surrounding structures, I can see the pancreas, it appears to be normal. There seems to be no abnormalities in the pancreas or dilation in the main pancreatic duct. I am able to visualize the common bile duct. It appears normal. It measures about 1.4 mm in diameter. There seems to be no evidence of stones, wall thickening or dilation. The diurnal mucosa is also normal on both endoscopic and ultrasound imaging. I'm beginning withdrawal of the endoscope. On withdrawal, I'm not able to see any evidence of bleeding or complications at the biopsy site. Withdrawal of the structures, the mucosa look normal, there seems to be no other abnormalities of any kind. Withdrawal is now complete.
