cyst03," This is Dr. Venkat Akshanthala dictating the procedure for an operandoscopic ultrasound with fine needle aspiration and EGD, esophageal gastrodiagnoscopy with biopsy performed on a female patient, test for whose date of birth is the 20th of August 1981 and medical record number is 3446548. The procedure is being conducted at the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center and today is the 17th of January 2025. The patient's a 62 year old female who's presenting for evaluation of GERD and an incidentally discovered pancreatic head cyst on previous imaging. We're using the the EG29I10 and EG34J10U endoscopes. We are now commencing the procedure. I am now introducing the high def endoscope through the mouth and advancing it under direct visualization. visualization. As I pass the scope through the esophagus, I can observe a LA grade C esophagitis with mucosal breaks involving more than 75% of the circumference, but I can't see any deep alterations. It's involving 75% of the circumference but without deep alterations. There is also a 2 cm high atrial hernia. It could be classified as a Hill Grade 3. There is no proximal inlet patch that I can see. The esophageal mucus otherwise appears to be normal with no nodularity, strictures or masses. I am biopsying the mid and the proximal esophagus to rule out eosinophilic esophageitis. Glycolysis. The gastroesophageal junction is noted at 33 cm from the incisors with a diaphragm pinch noted at 35 cm. I'm now advancing the scope into the stomach. The gastric mucosa appears to be normal with no ulcers, erosions or mast lesions. I'm taking random biopsies here to rule out Helicobacter pylori infections. I'm now continuing to advance the scope into the first and second portions of the duodenum, where the mucus appears to be normal here, without any erythema, ulcerations or villous blunting. I'm now withdrawing the gastroscope and introducing the echo-inter-scope to the patient's mouth. I'm now passing through the esophagus. The mucosa remains unchanged from prior evaluation. It's just the L.A. gritty esophagitis that can be noted. The scope is advanced in the stomach. And I'm now pushing the endoscope in the second portion of the diodium. Pancreatic Pancrema The cyst has no mural nodules, no gallicifications and no obvious connection with the membrane periodic dot. I am using a 22 gauge aspiration needle to perform FNA. I can confirm using color Doppler that no intervening vascular structures are present before beginning the puncture. Beginning the first pass, I'm able to obtain about 60 c of clear viscous fluid that I've aspirated. Oh, two grams of IV of cefetetan was administered prior to the puncture just for good measure for infection prophylaxis. The main pentatonic duct appears to be normal and measures about 3.0 mm in the head and 1.3 mm in the body and 0.6 mm in the tail. I'm now visualizing the bilirubin tree. I can see that the common bile duct is now dilated and measures about 5.1 mm just below the hilum with no stone strictures or abnormalities. The gallbladder appears normal But I can see some micro lithiasis without mural thickening or peripolytistic fluid No peripancreatic, periportal or coelac axis lymph nodes can be visualized Now visualizing the liver and the portions that I'm visualizing in the liver demonstrate a hepatic steatosis with mild blunting of the liver edge There are no mass lesions or intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation. I I can't see any ascites or nodular dipostures either. I'm beginning withdrawal of the scope and re-evaluating the visualized structures on withdrawal. Withdrawal is almost complete and there's no evidence of bleeding. Withdrawal is now complete. There's no immediate complications. The patient appears to be stable. The estimated blood loss is none. This is the end of procedure."
