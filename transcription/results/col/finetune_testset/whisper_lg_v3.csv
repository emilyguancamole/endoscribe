163, here is test patient 163 he is a 68 year old man coming here for a colonoscopy screening for average risk of colorectal cancer his last colonoscopy was five years ago. The overall prep quality is adequate. The colonoscope is introduced through the anus and advanced till the cecum. The Boston bowel prep score Boston scale in the right colon is 2 in the transfer colon is 2 and the Boston ball prep score Boston scale in left colon is 3 so the total Boston ball prep score is 7. The colonoscope is advanced through the anus into the cecum and which is identified by the appendix and the ileocecal valve. The colonoscope colonic mucosa is then carefully examined in a circumferential fashion on on the scope during withdrawal. There is small and medium sized diverticula throughout the colon consistent with moderate diverticulosis. No polyp is seen during the withdrawal. The The colonoscope is removed completely and the examination is complete.
Report_14_3," and I'm able to reach the cecum and the cecum looks normal, the appendicellar orifice ileocecal wall appears normal and on my way back the descending colon looks normal, a mild diverticulosis in the sigmoid colon and retroflexion completely normal and I'm withdrawing the scope and the procedure is complete, end of procedure 14."
Report_14_2," and I am seeing some polyps on my way in. I am seeing some polyps in the transverse colon. So this is Paris 1S, nice classification type 2 polyp. So there are two polyps ranging from 4 to 6 mm in size in the transverse colon. So I am taking the polyps out using cold-snare polypectomy technique and I am able to get the polyp tissue."
63," This is test 63 and we're here with a 54 year old male who's here for a colonoscopy for the assessment following an average risk of colorectal cancer. The last procedure performed was in 2013 and I'm now beginning the procedure. I'm now inserting the scope. Scope is in and I'm now advancing the scope through the rectum to the sigmoid colon. I'm now in the left colon. The prep quality seems adequate. I am in the left colon and the prep score is 3. I'm advancing the scope up the descending colon through to the transverse colon and the prep quality is almost adequate. The prep score is 2. I'm now advancing the scope to the right colon and the prep score is 3. which brings the overall Boston ball prep score to 8. I am now advancing the scope up to the cecum. I've had no trouble getting the scope through to the cecum. I'm able to identify the ileocecal valve and the appendix. The cecum appears normal. I'm now beginning withdrawal of the scope. On my way back, in the ascending colon, I'm able to see a polyp, a flat elevation of the mucosa which seems to be a polyp. It's about 10 millimeters in size with a Paris classification of 02A and a Nice classification of type 1. I'm beginning endoscopic mucosal resection. I'm doing it piecemeal. I am injecting saline and methylene blue submucosally and I am attempting to raise the lesion. I am attempting resection with cold snare. The polyp is lifted well. Yes, advance the scope please. And the resection is now complete. I've retrieved the polyp tissue and I'm now withdrawing the scope further. I'm able to see a polyp about 3 mm in size in the transverse colon. It's a Paris Classification 1S sessile polyp. I'm using a cold snare to conduct the polypectomy. The polypectomy is now complete. And the tissue is now completely retrieved. I'm now withdrawing the scope. The remainder of the colon seems unremarkable to me. And the scope is now out. and this is the end of the procedure"
33, hi this is test 33 we have a 53 year old male for a colonoscopy for assessment of average risk for colorectal cancer he has no prehistory of colonoscopies and I'm starting the procedure now now I'm inserting the scope through the anus and I am moving towards the descending colon I see the overall pep quality is adequate and the Boston ball pep score in the descending colon is 2 now I am in the transverse colon and the Boston ball pep score in the transverse colon is 3 now I am moving to the right colon and the Boston ball preparation of right colon that is ascending colon score is 3 the overall score is 8 now I'm carefully advancing through the cecum I see illiosecal valve and appendiceal lobe the cecum looks normal now I'm withdrawing the scope I in the ascending transverse descending sigmoid colon rectum I see no remarkable findings as I'm withdrawing I see there is no masses polyps or mucosal abnormalities there is no abnormality in the retroflexed view I am removing the scope completely from the patient scope is out the procedure is completed test 33
Colon_72_2," So far the rectum, the sigmoid and the left colon have been a bit erythematous, but I will examine them in much more detail on my way back. I'm now advancing the scope to the cecum and I can see the appendix and the ileocecal valve. I'm advancing the scope further and I'm now on the terminal ilium."
Colon_72_3," The terminal ileum appears to be normal. I'm now withdrawing the scope, but I'm gonna be taking biopsies from the terminal ileum and here in the cecum just for good measure. I'm using cold forceps to take these biopsies. Here in the cecum, there seems to be some amount of market erythema."
Colon_72_1, and I'm now in the transfer school and the prep score here is 2 I'm not further bouncing the scope to the right colon the Boston prep score here is 2 as well the right colon the overall Boston ball prep score is 6
