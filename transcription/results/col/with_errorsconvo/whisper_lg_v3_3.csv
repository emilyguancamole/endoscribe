16," This is test 16. We have a 65-year-old female who's coming for colonoscopy for personal history of colon polyps. Her last colonoscopy was performed a year ago. I'm beginning the procedure now. I'm inserting the scope through the anus. The scope is in. Carefully advancing through the rectum. Is he oxygenating well? Everything's going okay? Okay, that's good, that's good. Do you need me to move anything here with the oxygen mask? No. Okay, that sounds good. So continuing to pass through the sigmoid, going through the descending colon. Now we're in the transverse colon. Continuing towards the ascending colon. We are in the ascending colon. Pamela, did you end up cooking that turkey roast for everybody? Oh, that's amazing. That's wonderful. Hope you guys enjoyed it. Great. The Boston Bow Prep score is being assessed along the way. The overall quality is adequate. The Boston Bow Prep score in the right colon is 3. Transverse colon is 1. No, wait, sorry, 3. Transverse colon is 3. Left colon is 3. total score of 9. Now we are in the cecum. I see the appendiceal orifice and the ileocecal valve. I see 5 polyps measuring from 3 to 13 millimeters in size. All are Paris 0 to 1S and NIS type 2. The 13mm polyp, I'm using saline to demarcate and lift the lesion. Now I'm resecting the polyp. Polyp is resected. Can I please have the hot snare? Okay. Yep. yep okay bring it down a little bit yep okay can you just turn it around a little okay perfect so the polyp is resected using hot endoscopic causal resection it is polyp is out i'm removing the other polyps with cold snare all polyps are retrieved you have it right you do okay great now I'm withdrawing the scope in the ascending colon I see a 15 millimeter polyp and a 5 millimeter polyp actually sorry the 15 millimeter one is actually 10 millimeters on closer inspection um they're both uh paris uh zero to one s nice type two i'm using a cold snare to retrieve the polyp polyp is out now i'm withdrawing the scope are you going to the colon cancer awareness marathon this uh upcoming weekend yeah we're going to try to make it Now I'm in the sigmoid colon, I see a 5mm and a 10mm polyp. Sorry, I forgot to mention, I went to the transverse colon and saw a 10mm polyp that I resected with cold snare. Polyp is out. As I mentioned earlier in the sigmoid colon, a 5mm and 10mm polyp resecting with a cold snare. and retrieved. In the sigmoid colon, I'm seeing two tattoos. I don't see any scar from prior polypectomy. I see some pancolonic diverticulosis. Yeah, so it looks like we're going to have a good day, I think. I really hope so. So this procedure went well. Excellent. Okay, I'm withdrawing the Scope completely out. Scope is out. There were no complications during the procedure. End of procedure 10, test 16."
24," Hi, today is 14 September 2024. This is test 24. We have a 65-year-old female with a history of weight loss and abdominal pain. Came here for colonoscopy for screening of colorectal cancer. Is she ready? Is she asleep? Okay, perfect. Now I'm beginning the procedure. actually can i have the head of the bed lowered please thank you so much um i'm inserting the scope through the anus carefully advancing through the rectum and passing the scope into the sigmoid colon moving towards the descending colon moving further into the transverse colon now into the ascending colon the boston bowel prep score is assessed along the way overall While prep quality is adequate, the score in each segment is a 3 on the right colon. Transverse colon is 3 and left colon is 3. Total score of 9. Advancing into the terminal ileum. Actually, I am unable to advance into the terminal ileum. I'm not going to actually do that. Never mind. I'm not advancing into the terminal ileum. um i do identify this ileocecal valve and the penteceal orifice and withdrawing my scope so what are you planning to do after fellowship have you figured out your jobs yet uh oh i see i see a polyp it's um maybe eight millimeters actually it's six millimeter six millimeter sessile polyp um uh class uh paris uh zero one s nice one in the ascending colon uh i see it has surface features suspicious for adenoma um versus uh sessile actually it's not suspicious for sessile it's suspicious for adenoma versus inflammatory polyp that's what i would say i'm resecting the polyp with a cold snare can i have a cold snare please thank you our section is complete the other parts of the colon seem to be normal so yeah you know when you interview for jobs you have to just be very careful to ask the right things etc yeah i know yep um i'm withdrawing the scope i'm retroflexing and it appears to be normal um don't forget to um pass by the doctor's lounge on the way out for doctor's day yeah okay i'm withdrawing the scope completely out of the body the scope is out there were no complications during the procedure end of procedure test 24 I don't know what I'm talking about."

Her last colonoscopy was performed on April 2024, and now I'm beginning the procedure. Scope in. Okay, great. She's asleep. She's doing well. Excellent. I'm inserting the scope through the anus. I'm carefully advancing through the rectum. I'm continuing to pass into the sigmoid colon. Now I'm entering the descending colon. Moving further, I see the splenic flexor followed by the transverse colon. Now I see the hepatic flexor. I'm going to need some pressure here, please. Yes, please. Thank you so much. It's just hard advancing here. Mm-hmm. Thank you. Can we reposition her a little bit? Perfect. Excellent. Okay. All right. And how was your Friday, everybody? Last weekend after we left? Good.

The Boston bowel prep score is overall adequate, I would say. The Boston prep score in the right colon is 3. Transverse colon is 3. And left colon is 2. Actually, I'm sorry, It's actually three. Okay. That's golden is three. Total score would be nine. The cecum is normal in the cecum. And next to the appendiceal orifice, I see a 20 millimeter laterally splitting lesion, which does not involve the appendiceal orifice. It's Paris LST. GM0, 2A, plus 1S, JNET, classification 2A. Okay, can I please get a hot snare? Okay, thank you so much. And lifting agent. Now I'm dissecting the lesion in a piecemeal fashion with endoscopic mucosal resection. I'm lifting the lesion, demarcating with a pre-mixed solution of heta starch and methylene blue, and I'm using a 10-millimeter captivator snare. No, actually, sorry. No, yeah, it is 10-millimeter. I'm treating the resection is complete and I'm treating the margin of the resected area using a snare soft tip coagulation now I'm closing the defect with two mantis clips I retrieved the specimen with a rough net so how are you doing with the baby. Is everything going okay? That's great. That's wonderful. Yeah, I know it's tough when they're young. Okay, now I am withdrawing the specimen with the Rostat and I'm withdrawing the scope. In the sigmoid colon, I see a five millimeter sessile polyp, Paris 0-1A Sorry, Paris 0-1S Nice 2 I'm resecting this with a cold snare. Resection is completed. As I'm withdrawing, I'm in the recto sigmoid at 20 centimeters from the anal verge. I see a 20 millimeter pseudodepressed lateral splitting lesion. I'm attempting to lift this lesion with a pre-mixed solution of head of starch and methylene blue, but it's not lifting. I'm not able to lift the lesion. Okay, I'm taking a biopsy from the center of the lesion with a cold forceps and sending this for histology. I'm placing a tattoo, 2 cm They're distal to on the opposite wall of the lesion. I'm withdrawing the scope. The scope is out. There were no complications during the procedure. This is the end of procedure test 11."
