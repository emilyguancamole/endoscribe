16," This is test 16. We have a 65-year-old female who's coming for colonoscopy for personal history of colon polyps. Her last colonoscopy was performed a year ago. I'm beginning the procedure now. I'm inserting the scope through the anus. The scope is in. Carefully advancing through the rectum. Is he oxygenating well? Everything's going okay? Okay, that's good, that's good. Do you need me to move anything here with the oxygen mask? No? Okay, that sounds good. So, continuing to pass through the sigmoid, going through the descending colon. Now we're in the transverse colon. Continuing towards the ascending colon. We are in the ascending colon. Pamela, did you end up cooking that turkey roast for everybody? Oh, that's amazing. That's wonderful. Hope you guys enjoyed it. Mm-hmm. Great. The Boston bowel prep score is being assessed along the way. The overall quality is adequate. The Boston bowel prep score in the right colon is 3. Transverse colon is 1. No, wait, sorry. 3. Transverse colon is 3. Left colon is 3. Total score of... 9. Now we are in the cecum. I see the appendiceal orifice and the ileocecal valve. I see 5 polyps measuring from 3 to 13 millimeters in size. All are Paris 0 to 1S and Nice type 2. The 13 millimeter polyp, I'm using saline to demarcate. And lift the lesion. Now I'm resecting the polyp. Polyp is resected. Can I please have the hot snare? Mm-hmm. Okay. Yep. Yep. Okay. Bring it down a little bit. Yep. Okay. Can you just turn it around a little? Okay, perfect. So the polyp is resected using hot endoscopic causal resection. It is... Polyp is out. I'm removing the other polyps with cold snare. All polyps are retrieved. You have it, right? You do? Okay, great. Now I'm withdrawing the scope. In the ascending colon, I see a 15 millimeter polyp and a 5 millimeter polyp. Actually, sorry, the 15 millimeter one is actually 10 millimeters on closer inspection. They're both Paris 0 to 1S, NIS type 2. I'm using a cold snare to retrieve the polyp. Polyp is out. Now I'm withdrawing the scope. Are you going to the colon cancer awareness marathon this... This... This... Upcoming weekend? Yeah, we're going to try to make it. Now I'm in the sigmoid colon. I see a 5 millimeter and a 10 millimeter polyp. Sorry, I forgot to mention. I went to the transverse colon and saw a 10 millimeter polyp that I resected with cold snare. Polyp is out. As I mentioned earlier, in the sigmoid colon, a 5 millimeter and 10 millimeter polyp resecting with a cold snare and retrieved. In the sigmoid colon, I'm seeing two tattoos. I don't see any scar from prior polypectomy. I see some pancolonic diverticulosis. Yeah, so it looks like we're going to have a good day, I think. I really hope so. So this procedure went well. Excellent. Okay, scope is... I'm withdrawing the scope completely out. Scope is out. There were no complications during the procedure. End of procedure 10, test 16."
24," Hi, today is 14 September 2024. This is test 24. We have a 65-year-old female with a history of weight loss and abdominal pain. Came here for colonoscopy for screening of colorectal cancer. Is she ready? Is she asleep? Okay, perfect. Now I'm beginning the procedure. Actually, can I have the head of the bed lowered, please? Thank you so much. I'm inserting the scope through the anus, carefully advancing through the rectum, and passing the scope into the sigmoid colon, moving towards the descending colon, moving further into the transverse colon, now into the ascending colon. The Boston bowel prep score is assessed along the way. Overall prep quality is adequate. The score in each segment is a 3 on the right colon, transverse colon, transverse colon is 3, and left colon is 3. Total score of 9. Advancing into the terminal ileum. Actually, I am unable to advance into the terminal ileum. I'm not going to actually do that. Never mind. I'm not advancing into the terminal ileum. I do identify this ileocecal valve, and the pendyceal orifice. I'm withdrawing my scope. So what are you planning to do after fellowship? Have you figured out your jobs yet? Oh, I see a polyp. It's maybe 8 millimeters. Actually, it's 6 millimeters. 6 millimeters sessile polyp. Uh, class, uh, Paris, uh, 0, 1, S, Nice, 1 in the ascending colon. Uh, I see it has surface features suspicious for adenoma, um, versus, uh, sessile. Actually, it's not suspicious for sessile. It's suspicious for adenoma versus inflammatory polyp. That's what I would say. I'm resecting the polyp with a cold snare. Can I have a cold snare? Please? Thank you. Resection is complete. The other parts of the colon seem to be normal. So, yeah, you know, when you interview for jobs, you have to just be very careful to ask the right things, etc. Yeah, I know. Yep. Um, I'm withdrawing the scope. I'm retroflexing. It appears to be normal. Um, don't forget to, um, pass by the doctor's lounge on the way out for doctor's day. Yeah. Okay. I'm withdrawing the scope completely out of the body. The scope is out. There were no complications during the procedure. End of procedure test 24."
