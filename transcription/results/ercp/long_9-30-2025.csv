' I'm going to miss this. 'Ohio's features. ' Okay, please stop at the neck, measures one millimeter. 'Here's normal. ' Thank you. ' We have two of them now. 'The pancreas head also has full size strands and moderate modularity. 'I have the same video also there. 'The pancreatic tract of the neck appears normal from this video as well. ' For the next patient, sell this in. 'Yeah, you can. 'It's a 19-gauge extract. 'It will preload everything. ' I have based knowledge of producing, moving their nut fixes, producing light and all patients being protected in the nut cell. 'Stone for sludge.

' Stop it when you feel strong hold it. 'And then we're back to the strength. 'And now keep your feet down. ' Everything looks normal on the limited examination of the stomach esophagus and abdomen. 'Can you switch to USV please? ' CBD is 3 mm normal appearing ' Thank you. ' Ankylotic duct in the head is 1.1. 'No thickened wall, no hyperarchaic wall. 'The papillons appear normal, right? 'Yes. ' The cyst is supposed to be in the head, right? 'The 3 cm? 'Did they aspirate at the other hospital? 'Did they do a molecular marker? ' . '. '. '. ' Yeah. ' let's see ' We've got some stuff on the stomach. 'Yeah, thank you very much. 'I think this is a fast flusher, but it's not... ' Let's just shot a little bit. 'Yeah, head and neck is what the . '. '. '. '. '. '. '. '. ' It's the inferior margin of the neck ' almost like exo-fighting at the lower side. ' I thought your pancreas PT is one millimeter. ' normal appearing that wall push in and go towards the neck again stay there ' Talk left and right. ' When did they aspirate this? 'About six months ago. 'Six months ago. 'It's not like recently, two weeks ago, right? 'No. 'Let me take a look now. ' So, in April was the previous one? 'April, the last one. 'Was the FMA? 'The MRI was in June, that's like 23 months. 'Was that? 'That was in June. ' Yeah. 'Yeah. 'Yeah. ' Oh, OK. ' Unless it's been aspirated out and what does the CEA tell you? ' What was the measurement? 'The CEA, amylase, glucose, anything like that. 'So they must have analyzed, right? 'Yeah, and looked back. 'It was all a mullet. ' . '. '. '. ' Okay. ' Yeah, that's what I was thinking. 'I thought it was power. 'That's what I initially thought, but it keeps coming up. 'I think that's my biggest concern. 'Is that something that... The location adds up. 'Yeah. ' It does not look like bowel. 'Right, because it doesn't have the holes, almost like that. 'Yeah, sometimes it's almost like a sand dollar sign, but it doesn't have that. ' I wasn't sure, but I think the more and more I look at it, I don't think it's even its bowel. ' So this looks very exo-fighting. 'Yeah. 'And in the MRA also it looks like this. 'Exactly. 'It's not like . 'Yeah. 'So there's a lot of solid components with that. 'Yes. ' Why didn't you go in bio? 'I picked 22 sections. ' And my people are scared a few times, but I know it's a very good chance to find something else. ' Yeah. 'I mean, even Shabkot is fine for this. 'Yeah. 'Very interesting region. 'The location is like perfect. 'We need to go back and see if he had any synchrotitis and all that stuff. 'Make sure that the vessel is not leaking. ' so i'm going to do the vessels that's good ' I'll try to get slightly different . 'I'll change the user settings for you. 'This is better. ' You can see the lesion better now. 'Use the elevator and go down a little bit. 'Down a little bit. 'Yeah. 'One moment. 'You're good. ' we will have very small amount of fluid with priorities for the DNA stay there in that cystic cavity in between it's a mixed solid cystic lesion very exophytic ' hypoechoid well defined it has a thick wall no significant vascularity with them no calcifications ' stay within and you can go in and out in and out in the sense of staying within the lesion. 'So, you can get some pieces of tissue also you can send for analysis you are in that nice cystic space. 'So, I am hoping that it will collect some fluid very strange looking lesion. ' Yeah, I would say so. 'I don't know how diagnostic this would be. 'NCLE would be very tough getting in. ' so so ' Even if we get a solid piece of tissue, we can still process the DNA. ' And if this was indeed an IPMN with a solid growth in it, this would have been a cancer by now. 'Based on what? 'Yeah, I can't think of it. ' Sometimes, you know, they just see some mucin and they'll say it's mucinous cystic. 'And it could be just small ball gastric ulcer. 'If it's cytology, it's like highly unreliable. 'If your location is good, I would go for a sharp coat for the next one. ' do you think you want to take another path to start growth to get some solid part i want to see how much we have or do we have anything okay so let's push this let's uh let's take this to dna and see how much material we have and based on that we might go do one more pass okay ' All right. ' Okay. 'I think that's fine. 'Yeah. 'We'll take one more pass and we'll send it to Scytheridge next run. 'Oh, okay. 'So this is enough for this run? 'That's enough, yeah. ' Do you want the next task with the... I could see some solid part in that needle, so it's fine. 'Very interesting. 'And I was thinking to make sure it's not stewed or anything inside. ' This is a good view. 'This is the pancreas neck of the agent. 'This is the pancreas neck of the agent. 'Let me show you about the vessel. 'This is a much safer spot. ' Stay in that plane to go from there down. 'One day time. ' It's more like exophytic. 'I don't know if it's part of pancreas. 'It doesn't move much. 'Could be an SPN also. 'It's predominantly solid. ' The actuations are very good, so you can get like good amount of material whatever it is. 'Norman we are less than 5 minutes. ' So can the technology differentiate, like, will it put that in your notes, like, Norman, we're left with five minutes. 'It will not. 'It won't. 'It won't. 'So there is something called grounding. 'So every AI is trained to do certain things. 'The new generation of AI has something called grounding. ' So the grounding tells it what is important and what is not. 'If I tell Muni, get me this needle and all, it will not put that in. 'It's not a scribe. 'It's not like voice to speech, like speech to text. 'It has a little bit smarter. 'That's a little scary. ' Yes, I mean the issue now is our hardware is not that good. 'So, I am trying to be a little bit louder and you also need to be a little bit louder. 'But in the future, I mean it will be much better. ' Okay, everything looks good. 'Good. ' Thank you. 'Thanks."
3,,"after the procedure. 'So I mentioned you're just entering the esophagus, so on. 'All right. 'So keep talking, as if you're explaining this to somebody else. 'Just entering the esophagus. 'There are some problems with vascularity, but there are some spares here. 'Entering the stomach and cleaning the antrum. ' looks the same as before yeah you did the last glue right yes so the side of previous glowing ' Looks completely ischemic. 'I don't see any other prominent... There are viruses, but they're not dead. 'Yeah. 'I'm trying to feel this one here at 5 o'clock. 'It feels soft. 'There are, but I don't know. 'It's not that big. 'Yeah. 'Yeah, these... I think this too, almost. 'Or maybe this one? ' The cluster, the biggest cluster, the important one is there. 'Yeah. 'So feel the one at 12 o'clock. 'Yeah. 'This one? 'Yeah. 'See if it's hard or soft. 'It's soft. 'It feels soft. 'The crown over there. ' They're all like small and scattered. 'It's not like one big round, right? 'So that's the reason, say if you inject, it will just escape out. 'Unless you put these coils and all those things to trap the glue. ' So because they are like clusters of multiple, I would not be too keen on injecting now and just continuous as well, especially it's been doing so well. 'So last time we did this was six months ago? 'No. 'I want to say that earlier. 'Okay. 'So around six months ago, let's just follow up in six months and we can try to re-inject at that time. ' It's also not as much pro-hypnosis gastropathy, very mild. ' The tensions are 45. 'Norman, we are almost done. ' Looks like Grape 1 there, right? 'Where it's got one problem at 3 o'clock. 'It does flatten almost completely. 'They're scarring, but this still stops. 'Yes, 2 o'clock. 'More problem than Vex Bustles here. ' They're flattening, right? 'Or do you think they're big enough for a bandage? 'Norman, actually a few more minutes. 'You want to cut? 'Yes. 'Either is fine. 'I mean, whatever you want to do. ' 30 and 36 makes sense, about 30. 'Just remember that when you pan the esophagus, you can put this here. 'You can put it here. 'When you pan the esophagus, the pressure might be diverted to stomach. 'Jordi, for coho? 'Oh, no. ' Girl, why are you working without glasses? 'Because I broke them and I need my new ones to come in. 'I thought there was something different about you today. ' How are you here? 'I'm hoping to come in tomorrow. 'Everyone's high for me. 'I like my black ones. 'I put them on the sofa and sat on them. 'I put them on the sofa. ' That's hilarious. 'I'm so sad. 'It's okay when it isn't there anymore. 'Right. 'It's fine. 'This is not the week. 'This is not the week. 'Can you imagine? 'Are you going to be free? 'Are you going to be free? 'No, normally I am. 'But I'm going to be free now. ' The NAFP with the, um, the conspicuous. 'Oh, for Thursday or Friday? 'Oh, I don't know. 'Friday. 'We're not doing anything Thursday. 'We have the nursing track Thursday. 'Yeah, yeah, yeah. 'Live. 'Oh, I think that's for nursing track for Thursday. 'Yeah. 'And then Friday, I think me and you are doing cryo. 'I can't tell. 'Unless they changed it. 'I don't know. ' And fiducials with chin, like the last cases. 'No one told me that. 'I thought I was just, don't. 'It's okay. 'I normally do have a fiducial, but I have that condition. 'I'm like, I definitely need my classes, doctor. 'Oh, yeah, she was doing. ' I also had to shoot. 'I believe you. 'You said all these things, so I thought you'd tell me all these things. 'It's all good. 'It's all good. 'At least I know how to do the basics. 'Yeah. 'So now we are back in this office, looking at the license. 'Don't put me in an ER seat. 'If I'm not in an ER seat, don't put me in an ER seat. ' one band ' It looks a little bit more juicy, a little bit more strong. 'It's a little bit more head-stripped. 'They are trying to make the sauce a little bit slow. 'They are making it a little bit slow. ' Yeah, on Friday. 'I don't think that's that big. 'I don't think it is that big. 'Should be slightly bigger, maybe more proximal. 'Come back to that. ' okay three bands deployed scope out"
4,,"8 o'clock procedure, room 205, 9.30, 2025. ' that we can track. 'I don't know, you're good. 'We're good, we're good. 'There we go. 'Oh, hi. 'That's what I was gonna say. ' We are doing an EUS, so this is esophagus, some examination of esophagus, and now we're re-adding the stomach. ' End of view pictures. 'You want to focus on this bankless stage because the sits are there so you can start doing FNA and in between FNA. 'Yes, yellow one. ' You can talk it is fine. 'The pancreas duct in the body is 1.4 millimeter and how do you describe the ecogenicity? ' Scattered foci and strands here and there. 'I do see a lot of strands. 'Some lobularity. 'And there's some fatty focal infiltration as well on the body. 'Agree. 'Yeah, there on the left side more. 'The duct wall looks normal. 'No hyperechoic or thickened duct wall. 'Duct is not dilated. 'You can get this clean. 'It's fine too. ' Definitely some locularity. 'It's not to almost that honeycomb-ing level. 'They look pretty decent there, more in the tail. ' There's a decent amount of lobular pain. 'Let's find the cyst so we can go into the clinic. 'I know it's inside of my head. 'Head? 'Okay, I thought it was tape. '23? 'Okay. 'Last MRI, it does say 3. ' okay ' Okay. ' I think you are right, this is a typo. 'In the report, they wrote it as tail, but in the images, I can see it in the head. 'Yeah, that's okay. 'That's the neck duct. 'Touching the neck is 1.3. 'Okay, AD in the neck, 1.3. ' so so ' You can see the gallbladder that looks normal. ' I only want to see what we've done with how old we are. 'But, it's really worth it. 'I thought we'd go to... Okay. 'We're going to go to Moscow. 'We're going to go to Moscow. 'We're going to go to Moscow. ' That's what I'm looking at. ' It is head and snake edition. ' Now we are in D2, second portion of duodenum. 'This part looks a little more fatty. 'Yeah, it looks a little more fatty. ' It's pretty funny. ' No. 'Oh, it wasn't dirty. 'It really wasn't dirty. 'That's why it was dirty. 'But it was dirty. 'It was. 'It was. 'It was dirty. 'No, we had dirty clothes, too. 'We had dirty clothes. 'We had dirty clothes. ' Very cloudy. 'Yeah. ' Yeah, that's true. ' Thank you. 'Thank you. ' it's not that big expect 22 suction ' It's a small cyst so whatever we get we'll send it to DNA and I placed the order already. 'Good job finding it. ' So, stay stable there, but once you, as you get the needle down, oops, is it sharp core? 'Need to expect. 'I said expect. 'No, it's okay. 'You got two U's too. 'Thank you. ' Last Friday, we tested a new device to freeze the pancreas test with cryo. 'Oh, great. 'Beautiful, beautiful. ' First time ever in the intestine. 'So what do you do? 'You just drain the cyst? 'Nothing. 'You don't need to drain. 'It's not RFA. 'Okay. 'It doesn't care whether there's fluid, the viscosity of fluid, all that stuff. 'Of course, if it's smaller, then you need to do less ablations. 'So if it's like much larger, you might need to do two ablations. ' Beautiful. 'It's a porcine ex vivo. 'So we looked at the tissue, looked at the cyst, everything after to see like how much further into the pancreas it extends. 'In the future we will be checking for pancreatitis and all. 'And what do you use for the trial? 'It's hypercooled nitrogen gas, not liquid. ' So there is no place to expand within a pancreas despite unlike a Barrett's. 'So it's a needle catheter through which it circulates. 'Yeah. ' Slightly get off plane from the vessel. 'Not sure. 'And turn it on though. 'But get off plane from the vessel. 'You can see the SMV going down there. 'Relax your elevator. 'Come this way a little bit. 'And then we can down a little bit. 'And then rotate your scope so that I don't see this vessel. ' Yeah. 'I think I'm just about done. 'I can't tell. 'You can turn it on. 'It's fine. 'Okay, good. 'Now you're ready. 'Now you're ready. 'Turn it on. 'Okay. ' Go left and right a little bit and try to find the tip of the needle. ' show me the cyst better yeah good pushing a little bit ' It's just the viscosity, sometimes it takes time. 'And let's give her dose of antibiotic please, ANSYF is fine. 'Thank you. 'So what was the cyst size? '16. 'Yeah, don't be pressured. ' Sometimes there could be some debris at the tip of the needle too on the tissue piece. ' Sometimes it may be some debris and things. 'So you try to go in and out a little bit hoping that the tissue piece will fall off. ' If that does not work, then you need to push in with a stylet. 'Monique, can you have a stylet ready, please? 'I think there's some tissue debris. 'We need to push it out. 'But you should hold the needle very tightly as the stylet goes in and out, OK? 'And also, as the stylet comes back, you can come back to hold it. 'Turn off, yeah. ' You just keep an eye on the needle, nothing else. 'You are in a good spot. ' You can take it out and redo the suction on the syringe and you can reconnect. ' Thank you. ' you would see this collapsing also with the reflectivity coming out just go in and out into it and now that we are off plane so we have some room to go in ' Just stay there for another minute. 'I need to avoid the smack center of this. ' Yeah, I'm sure there will be something in here. ' Take one more pass. 'Do the same when you work and keep off plane. 'Just go back in. 'Go off plane. 'Yes, nice. 'This is even better. 'Now you have slightly more freedom. 'Good. ' A little bit of blood mixed with fluid, that's fine. 'We can send it all to DNA only. ' Don't be stuck in my needle. 'Okay. 'I want the DNA. 'Gotcha. 'Yeah? 'Okay. ' I haven't been given a live case. ' Yes. 'I'm not in here. 'But I was in the YCC for two years. 'Two years. 'At the time. 'I didn't know. 'I didn't know. 'She was saying that I'm not going to do it. 'Oh, my gosh. 'Yes. ' If you keep walking with the other sister, they can come out. 'Because we have some longer spaces to come. 'Other sisters? 'Yeah, I've got it. ' It's supposed to be 7 in the body and 10 in the chin. 'I'll go talk to the last patient. ' There we go. ' Okay. ' . '. '. '. ' me me ' um ' So, ' 3mm tail cyst and 7mm body cyst. 'No concerning feature? 'No. 'Possible ducal communication or nothing?"
