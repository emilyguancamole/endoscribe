bdstricture09," Hello, this is Dr. ABC. On September 17, 2024, I'm performing an ERCP with balloon dilation and spyglass cholangioscopy with biopsy on a 57-year-old female. Indications for her procedure are evaluation of a bile duct stricture in a patient with a history of cirrhosis secondary to autoimmune hepatitis with possible primary sclerosing cholangitis. Previously on immunomodulators, later removed from the transplant list due to loss of follow-up. Recent episode of acute hepatitis E referred for ERCP with biopsy for further evaluation of biliary stricture. Now I'm beginning the procedure. She is in left semi-prone position. Intravenous sedation was administered. I'm using an Olympus TJFQ180V duodenoscope. Now I'm advancing the scope through the mouth. Now entering the esophagus. slowly entering the stomach now I'm moving towards the second part of the duodenum I see the esophagus in the stomach were normal a scout film showed no abnormalities and the major papilla appeared normal upon visualization the The bile duct is deeply cannulated using a sphincterotome preloaded with a 0.025 inch visiglide wire. Cholangiogram shows a prolonged tight stricture in the common bile duct and diffuse stricturing of the intrahepatic ducts. There is no dominant focal stricture. I see filling defects within the cystic ducts. It looks like stones. 6 mm biliary sphincterotomy is performed using ERBE electrocautery with no bleeding observed. Common bile duct is dilated using a 4 mm hurricane balloon to allow passage of the spyglass cholangioscope. I am performing a spyglass cholangioscopy. It shows diffuse fibrosis and stricturing without any focal concerning lesions. I am taking multiple SpyBite biopsies. I am using a stone retrieval balloon to perform multiple sweeps of the proximal duct. I am unable to remove small stones and debris due to narrow ducts and the small size of the debris. Now, after completion of the procedure, I am removing the scope. scop, the scope is out, there were no immediate complications, the procedure was successfully completed."
bdstricture03," Today is February 1st, 2024 and we are in the endoscopy suite. This is Dr. ABC performing an ERCP with stent removal, cannulation of the papilla and stent placement on a 19-year-old male. Indications for the procedure is follow up for a known bile duct stricture, history of hilar biliary stricture and chronic thalassification pancreatitis, initial concern for malignancy, but prior biopsies and imaging showed no evidence of progression, suggesting a benign etiology. The patient has undergone serial ERCPs since 2017 with the last ERCP performed in August 2020, during which a 10 French into 15 cm plastic stent was placed. He now returns for re-examination and stent exchange. I'm beginning the procedure. The patient is in a left semi-prone position and intravenous sedation was administered. I'm advancing the Olympus TJF Q180V duodenoscope was advanced through the mouth, esophagus and stomach, reaching the second part of the duodenum without difficulty. The ERCP finding shows a scout film confirmed the presence of a biliary stent in situ. The duodenoscope was advanced without a detailed upper J-examination. A single plastic stent was visualized at the major papilla and successfully removed using a snare. The prior biliary sphincterotomy was found to be patent. The bile duct was deeply cannulated using a sphincterotome, preloaded with a 0.035-inch guide wire, which was advanced into the intrahepatic ducts with ease. A cholangiogram revealed a mild, short, highlarge structure measuring approximately 5 mm, extending from the hilum bile duct successfully. The scope is now completely withdrawn. There was minimal blood loss. There were no immediate complications. The procedure was successfully completed. End of procedure."
bdstricture05," Today is February 1st, 2025 and we are in the endoscopy suite. This is Dr. ABC performing an ERCP with calculus removal and stent exchange on an 89-year-old male patient. Indication for these procedures are treatment of recurrent cholangitis and bile duct strictures. Past history includes biliary strictures and choledocholipiasis. Status post, electrohormonic lithotripsy in August 2017. Secondary sclerosing, cholangitis, hypertension, mild dementia, clostridioids, difficile infection, depression, deep vein thrombosis in 2017, and cerebral ischemia. There was multiple previous ERCPs. The last one on July 17, 2020, revealed persistent strictures at the left hepatic duct, right anterior hepatic duct, and right posterior hepatic duct. At that time, strictures were dilated to 6 mm and 3,7 French into 15 cm stents were placed, one in each. The patient is now present with intractable nausea and subjective fevers, raising concerns for low-grade cholangitis. I'm beginning the procedure. The patient is positioned in left semi-prone position and intravenous sedation was administered. I am introducing the Olympus TJF-Q180VN duodenoscope. I am advancing it from the mouth into the esophagus and will be advancing to the stomach and the duodenum. As I am advancing, I don't have any difficulty. Visual inspection of the esophagus, stomach and duodenum shows no abnormalities. A scout film prior to incision revealed three previous placements in the common bile duct. The major papilla was identified in the second part of the duodenum with evidence of a prior sphincterotomy, old stent removed using rat tooth forceps and a snare, bile duct cannulation is performed using a sphincterotome and guide wire, achieving deep cannulation successfully. Now introducing three separate guide wires into the left hepatic duct and then into the right anterior hepatic duct and right posterior hepatic duct. In a limited cholangiogram, it reveals that persistent intrahepatic structures present, but I see improvement compared to the prior imaging. I am using stone extraction balloon to sweep the bile duct twice from the hilum. Multiple small stone fragments were removed successfully. Now three new 7 French x 15 cm Boston Scientific Advanix Rapid Duodenal Blend Bendi biliary plastic stents are placed. One in each of left hepatic duct, right anterior hepatic duct and right posterior hepatic duct. Now I am removing the scope. The scope is withdrawn out completely.

bdstricture04," Today is February 1st, 2024 and we are in the endoscopy suite. This is Dr. ABC performing an ERCP with stent replacement on a 78-year-old female. Indications for her procedure are therapy for a known bile duct stricture, history of locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma on forferinox, chemotherapy, V-shape, complicated by portal vein thrombus with associated portal hypertension resulting in ascites and suspected portal biliopathy leading to hemobilia. The patient has an indwelling metal bile duct stent and was admitted with nausea and ascites. A recent interventional radiology stenting procedure was performed for PVT on December 2nd with post-procedure imaging revealing a thrombus at the stent site. Also notable for E. coli, bacteremia and hypertension, both of which has since improved. EGD and ERCP were requested for further evaluation management. I'm beginning the procedure. The patient is in left semi-prone position and intravenous sedation was administered. I'm inserting the Olympus GIF-1TH190 therapeutic gastroscope and Pentax ED34-I10 duodenoscope. I'm advancing from the mouth through the esophagus, stomach and into the second part of the duodenum. As I'm moving in the stomach, there is mild portal hypertensive gastropathy with no signs of active bleeding or obstructive pathology. As I am moving forward in the duodenum there is mild narrowing at D1-D2 junction but no significant obstruction was present and the scope passed through without difficulty. At the major papilla the previously placed metal bile duct stent was visualized. The showing minimal proximal migration. The bile duct or stent is cannulated using a 9 to 12 mm balloon preloaded with a 0.025 inch straight Visiglide wire. The guide wire was successfully advanced into the intrahepatic ducts. Colangiogram findings shows injection of contrast revealed debris within the stent. Multiple balloon sweeps were performed. Successfully removed a small amount of sludge from the bile duct stent. Now to improve the bile flow, a second metal bile duct stent is being placed coaxially within the existing stent. A Boston Scientific Wall Flex Stent into 40mm fully covered self-expandable metal stent was successfully deployed over the guide wire.

spyglass09," Today is the 16th of September 2024 and we're here at the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center in the endoscopy suite and this is Dr. Venkat Akshintala. We're performing an ERCP with spyglass cholangoscopy and bile duct sweeps on an 80-year-old male who's presenting for evaluation removal of bile duct debris. The patient has history of recurrent cholangitis after cholecystectomy in 2006. Multiple prior ERCPs for debris removal. ERCP in June of 2013 showed a widely patent biliary sphincterotomy with reflux of solid food into the bile duct causing intermittent cholangitis. ERCP in April of 2014, debris was removed from the biliary system. ERCP in November of 2019 showed no filling defects, sphincteroplasty was performed and no debris was retrieved. ERCP in March of 2020 in the setting of cholangitis, no debris was identified. He is now referred for a repeat elective ERCP to assess for recurrent debris. IV sedation is administered and I am now commencing the procedure. I'm advancing the Olympus TJF Q180V duodenoscope through the mouth, passing it into the esophagus, which appears normal and limited views, and advancing into the stomach, which is also normal and limited views. I'm directing the scope into the second portion of the duodenum. A scout film for the abdomen is performed. Peri-ampliary diverticulum is noted. There is evidence of prior biliary sphincterotomy, which remains widely open. Now proceeding with biliary cannulation, I'm using a 12-15mm stone retrieval balloon preloaded with the hydrojag wire. Contrast injection under fluoroscopic guidance shows CBD dilation of up to 14mm, mild intrahepatic ductal dilation and fling defects within the CBD that is consistent with debris accumulation. I'm now performing multiple balloon sweeps of the bile duct, removing large amounts of debris. Further balloon sweeps are not presenting any additional material. I'm advancing the SpyGlass digital cholangioscope and I'm examining the common bile duct, the common hepatic duct, and branches next to the hilum. I'm not able to see any strictures of growth in the bile ducts. Injecting a final contrast to confirm and this final contrast injection confirms a clear bile duct with no remaining debris. I'm now withdrawing the spikeless cholangioscope and diodenoscope. The estimated blood loss is minimal. There appears to be no complications. This is the end of procedure."

This is Dr. Venkat Akshintala and we're performing an ERCP with stent exchange, balloon dilation, biopsy, and spyglass cholangioscopy in a 75-year-old male presenting for therapy of a bile duct stricture. The patient initially developed jaundice and pruritus with a fever or pain and was evaluated in an outside hospital where elevated liver enzymes were noted. MR-IMRCP showed dilated intrahepatic ducts and a CBD stricture. Liver tumor board at the Johns Hopkins Hospital reviewed the imaging and described it as a tight stricture and a proximal CBD without a discrete mass. Oncology worker was negative for malignancy and the patient was referred for ERCP. IV sedation is being administered and I'm now commencing the procedure. I'm advancing the Olympus TJF Q180 video on the scope through the mouth and passing it into the esophagus which appears normal on limited views and I'm advancing it further into the stomach which is also normal on limited views. I'm directing the scope into the second portion of the duodenum. Scout film of the abdomen has been performed and showing previously placed plastic stents traversing the hilum. The duodenoscope is advanced to the major papilla without detailed examination of the upper GI tract. I am now removing the previously placed plastic stents using rat tooth forceps. The major papilla shows evidence of prior sphincterotomy. I have achieved biliary cannulation using a sphincterotome preloader with Visiglide wire. Comments in contrast to injection under fluoroscopic guidance, which shows a long tight stricture in the proximal CBD involving the hilum and extending it to the right and left intrahepatic ducts. It's about a basement for classification. There's a mild intrahepatic ductal dilation. Now advancing the supply class digital cholangioscope, I'm examining the common bile duct, the common hepatic duct, the right and left intrahepatic ducts. I'm not able to examine the right intrahepatic duct because of extensive strictures. The distal CBD appears to be normal. The hilum and the proximal CBD show nodular appearance alongside narrowing and dilated tartarous vessels. I'm taking multiple SpyBite biopsies from this area. I'm performing a serial balloon dilation of the stricture using a 4mm hurricane balloon to facilitate stent placement. I'm now placing a 7 French 12cm plastic bile duct stent into the right intrahepatic duct and a 7 French 15cm plastic bile duct stent into the left intrahepatic duct. A third stent could not be placed due to limited space. I'm performing a final cholangiogram now which confirms good portioning of the stents. I'm now drawing this PyGlas, cholangioscope and diadenoscope. The blood loss is minimal. The patient appears to be stable. The scope is out and this is the end of procedure."

The patient has a history of factor V Leiden, factor VII and factor X deficiencies, multiple DVDs, sarcoidosis. She was found to have a high laryngo mass causing biliary obstruction and enlarged ciliac lymph nodes in MRI and MRCP. The case was reviewed by the liver tumor board and the patient was referred to Dr. Filasofi for further management. Concern was raised for cholangia carcinoma prompting referral for EU SNERCP with spyglass cholangioscopy. The last MRI-MRCP from July 23, 2020 showed a mass at the junction of the right and left common bile ducts, measuring 1.8 x 2.1 x 1.9 cm with mild internal restriction. Mild common hepatic duct dilation about 8 mm and CBD dilation about 6.5 mm. No choledochalotheasis, diffuse intrahepatic biliary dilation though, and gallbladder is surgically absent. The IV sedation has been administered and I'm now commencing the procedure. I'm advancing the Olympus TJF Q1 ATV duodenoscope through the mouth and passing it into the esophagus now, which appears normal, limited use. And I'm advancing into the stomach, which also appears to be normal. I'm directing the scope into the second portion of the duodenum. A scout film of the abdomen has been performed. We showed scattered erythema and erosions that are present in the diadenal bulb. The major papilla appears to be normal with a long infinity beam. I am now proceeding with biliary cannulation. I am using a sphincterotome preloaded with a 0.025 inch Visiglide wire. I am now performing a 6mm biliary sphincterotomy using ERB electrocardiogram with no bleeding observed. I'm now advancing the spyglass digital collingioscope and I'm examining the common bile duct, common hepatic duct and branches near the hyaline. The right intrahepatic ducts are not involved. The left intrahepatic ducts could not be clearly visualized. Debris and small stones can be seen in the common hepatic duct. A mass lesion is present in the distal common hepatic duct which is causing the lumen narrowing. The cystic duct opening is right adjacent to the lesion. I'm now taking multiple SpyBite biopsies from the mass lesion. To clear the bile duct, I'm performing a balloon sweep using a 12mm stone retrieval balloon. I've now successfully removed debris distal to the lesion. I'm going ahead to place a 7 French 15 centimeter straight plastic bile duct stent across the mass lesion into the right hepatic duct. Final cholangiogram, I'm performing one now just to confirm the stent placement and bile flow. The final cholangiogram shows good bile flow and confirms the stent placement. I'm now going to go ahead and withdraw the spyglass cholangioscope and the diodenoscope. blood loss is minimal, there seems to be no complications. This is the end of the procedure."

The patient has history of bipolar disorder, possible COPD, she's got multiple spinal surgeries done, chronic opioid use for abdominal pain, multiple prior abdominal surgeries. She's a status post laparoscopic cholecystectomy in 2020 at an outside hospital, which was done for an emphysematous A. calculus cholecystitis. Her lap curly was complicated by bile leak and biliary obstruction. Interventional radiology placed percutaneous biliary drainage on 24th of July 2020, and stent surgery, which was later accidentally dislodged. Sheena presents for EOS and ERCP evaluation. We are now commencing the procedure. IV sedation has been administered. I'm advancing the Olympus TJF Q180V duodenoscope through the mouth and passing it into the esophagus. Normal, which appears normal in limited views. I'm advancing it into the stomach, which contains solid food debris. I'm rotating the scope into the second portion of the duodenum. A scout film of the abdomen is performed which shows the presence of a surgical drain. The major papilla appears to be normal. I'm now proceeding with biliary cannulation. I'm using a sphincterotome preloaded with a 0.035 inch hydrojag wire. Contrast injection under fluoroscopy guidance shows a mildly dilated common bile duct. and a broke cut off of the CBD at the proximal middle level with no contrast flow at stream. I'm now performing a 6mm biliary sphincterotomy using ERB electrocardi with no bleeding that can be observed. I'm now advancing the spyglass digital cholangioscope and I'm examining the common bile duct and the common hepatic duct. The distal CBD appears to be normal. At the level of the CPD cutoff, there appears to be no intraluminal mass lesions that can be identified. A Visiglide 0.025 inch wire is what I'm using to probe the area, but I can't advance it any further. I'm using a contrast injection to confirm the contrast flow and the contrast injection confirms that there's no upstream contrast flow. Final cholangiogram confirms persistent obstruction of the proximal mid-CBD. Given these findings, I'm making the decision to repeat endoscopy tomorrow with EUS guided hepatic gastrostomy. Sorry, hepatic, hepatico gastrostomy. That's what I said. Yeah, sorry. I'm not withdrawing the spikeless cholangioscope and duodenoscope. The estimated blood loss is minimal.

He also has hypertension and diabetes. He was admitted in July of 2020 with abdominal pain and jaundice and was found to have no stones but some blood in the papilla, possibly from a path stone. During the ERCP, a 10 French 9cm plastic bile duct stem was placed. He then underwent cholecystectomy and is now presenting for ERCP for removal of the stent. The patient is in the semi-prone position, left lateral. Sorry, yeah, is now in the left semi-prone position and the intravenous sedation has been administered and we are now ready to begin. I'm advancing the Olympus DJFQ 180V duodenal scope through the mouth into the esophagus. The esophagus appears normal, unlimited views. I'm now advancing the scope into the stomach, which also looks normal. I'm now directing the scope towards the second portion of the duodenum. Here upon visualizing the major papilla, I can confirm that it looks normal. I'm now removing Having the previously placed plastic bile duct stent with a snare, the stent is removed without difficulty and there's no immediate bleeding at the site. I can also observe evidence of prior biliary sphincterotomy. I'm now cannulating the common bile duct with a 9-12 mm stone extraction balloon. The cystic duct has very low takeoff. I am performing multiple balloon sweeps of the bile duct and a small amount of sludge is removed. Further sweeps do not yield any additional sludge or calculus. I am now advancing the digital spyglass colonoscopy to the diodenoscope channel for direct visualization of the bile ducts. The common bile duct, the common hepatic duct, branches near the hilum and cystic duct stump are all carefully examined. I can't find any stone strictures or abnormalities in the biliary tree. The cystic duct stump appears to be long and normal. I'm not performing a cholangiogram and it shows no filling defects or calculus. There are no abnormalities in the biliary tree. I'm now withdrawing the scope. The scope is out. The estimated blood loss is none. And I can't observe any immediate complications. This is the end of procedure."
spyglass02," Today is the 17th of September 2020 and we're here in the endoscopy suite at the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center. This is Dr. Venkat Akshintala and we're performing an ERCP with stent removal and spyglass colonoscopy on a 40-year-old female Venkat Akshintala, Bayview Medical Center, ERCP, duodenum, duodenum, stent, French, Visiglide wire right upper quadrant, epigastric abdominal pain, acute elevation of liver enzymes, prior CD findings of cholera gluteus and contrast enhancing mass adjacent to the gallbladder. She underwent an EUS ERCP on the 21st of October last year, where a periportal ion was noted. Biopsy showed no malignancies and was found to be benign. During the ERCP, a cystic duct stone was identified and an ECE-7 stent was placed to prevent bleeding. The patient underwent a cholecystectomy on the 23rd of October last year, which showed chronic cholecystitis and gallstones. She's here today for a repeat ERCP to evaluate the bile duct and to remove the stent. We're now commencing the procedure. And I'm advancing the Olympus TGF Q18DV diurnoscope through the mouth into the esophagus, which appears normal in limited views. The scope is now being advanced to the stomach. which is unremarkable. I'm not directing the scope towards the second portion of the diodenum. Previously a scout film of the abdomen was performed and the metal bile duct stent was visualized in position. Upon visualizing the major papilla, I can see that there's a previously placed metal bile duct stent. I'm using the rat tooth forceps to carefully remove the stent. The stent comes out easily without resistance and there's no bleeding at the site. That's evidence of a widely patent biliary sphincterotomy. I'm preparing for biliary cannulation now using the sphincterotome preloaded with the guide wire. Injecting contrast now. The cholangiogram shows no filling defective stones in the bile duct. I'm now performing multiple sweeps of the bile duct with a 90-12 mm stone retrieval balloon. I can't find any stone or sludge that's present here. At this point, I'm now advancing the spyglass digital cholangioscope into the duodenoscope channel for direct visualization. I'm examining the common bile duct, the cystic duct stump, the common hepatic duct and branches near the hilum. I can see that the cystic duct stump is clear with no stones present. However, I do observe erythema around the cystic duct takeoff and the common bile duct. This probably represents reactive changes. I'm now taking multiple biopsies from the bile duct in this location to evaluate it further. There's good contrast in bile flow throughout the duct and I believe there's no stent that is needed at this time. I'm now withdrawing the scope completely and the procedure is complete. There's very minimal blood loss that's estimated and there seem to be no immunocomplications. This is the end of procedure."
spyglass04," Alright, today is the 17th of September 2024 and we're here in the endoscopy suite of the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center. This is Dr. Venkat Akshintala and we're performing an ERCP with balloon dilation biopsy and spikeless cholangioscopy on a 57-year-old female patient. She has a history of cirrhosis due to autoimmune hepatitis with possible overlap with primary sclerosing cholangitis. She was previously on immunomodulators but was removed from the transplant list due to loss of follow-up. She recently had an episode of acute hepatitis E and is now being referred for ERCP to evaluate biliary strictures. and take biopsies as well. Right. So we're ready to begin. And I'm now advancing the Olympus TJF Q18 TV duodenoscope through the mouth into the esophagus. The esophagus looks normal, unlimited views. I'm advancing the scope further into the stomach, which is also unremarkable. I'm now directing the scope towards the second portion of the diaglom. Upon visualizing the major papilla, I can confirm that it appears normal. I'm now proceeding with biliary cannulation. I'm using a sphincterotome preloaded with a 0.025 inch Visiglide guide wire. The bile duct is deeply cannulated and I am now proceeding to inject contrast. The cholangiogram reveals a long diffuse structure in the common bile duct as well as a structure of the intrahepatic ducts without a focal dominant structure. There are filling defects in the cystic duct which are suggestive of stones. I am now performing a 6mm biliary sphincterotomy using an ERBE electrocautery. There is no immediate bleeding following the sphincterotomy. I'm now using a 4mm hurricane balloon to dilate the common bile duct to facilitate the passage of the spyglass cholangioscope. The balloon dilation is successful and I'm now advancing the digital spyglass cholangioscope into the duodenoscope channel. The cholangioscope is carefully passed through the bile duct. Upon examination, the common bile duct, the common hepatic duct and branches near the hilum can be seen. There's diffuse stricturing and fibrosis throughout the bile duct, but no focal lesions of concern are seen. I'm taking multiple SpyBite biopsies from the bile duct in this region, but I'm going to admit that the biopsy samples are limited due to the fibrosis. While examining the proximal bile duct, I noticed the presence of sludge material and small stone debris. This is likely due to stasis. I am now advancing a guide wire into the proximal duct and performing stone retrieval using a balloon. After multiple sweeps, no stone debris can be removed, likely due to the small size of the debris and narrow ducts. The major rapid lab here is normal upon further inspection. I'm now completing the biopsy process and withdrawing the cholangia scope. The scope is now fully withdrawn and this is the end of procedure."
spyglass01," All right, today is the 17th of September 2024. We're here in the last week of the week at the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center. This is Dr. Venkat Akshintala, ERCP, which stands for mobile and SpyGlas, colon, GSRP. Our 87 year old male patient is here for the therapy for bile duct stone. He has a history of Belgrath's 2 anatomy from a previous peptic ulcer disease surgery. and his medical history is in the game for COVID-19, atrial fibrillation, bladder, bradycardia with a pacemaker, CKD2, dementia, PEG dependence and vocal cord paralysis. He was recently hospitalized for sepsis, pneumonia and ascending cholangitis. A previous ERCP was performed on the 16th of December in 2020, which revealed a large distal bile duct stone. Given the size of the stone, we decided to place the stent at that time. The patient is now here for a repeat ERCP and further management of the stone, including removal of the stent and stone fragmentation. We are now ready to begin and we are now commencing the procedure. I am now introducing the Olympus TJEQ18B duodenal scopes through the patient's mouth and advancing into the esophagus. The esophagus appears normal, unlimited views. I'm now advancing the scope into the stomach which also appears to be normal. Moving towards the second portion of the duodenum now, I can clearly see the major papilla. We are visualizing the previously placed bile duct stent in place and I'm now using rat tooth forceps to carefully remove the stent. The stent comes out without any issues. There is no bleeding at the site. I can see that there is evidence of prior biliary sphincterotomy as well. Next I'm preparing for biliary cannulation. I'm using a sphincter room preloaded with a 0.025 inch guide wire. Advancing the guide wire to the bile duct and injecting contrast. On the galangiogram we are visualizing a 2 cm calculus in the distal bile duct. Now loading the spikeless galangioscope into the duodenoscope channel, advancing it carefully to examine the common bile duct, the common hepatic duct and branches near the hyoid. The distal CBDE is where the large calculus is located. It appears to have been partially fragmented, likely due to the stent placement. I'm now performing electrohydraulic lithotripsy under normal saline irrigation. The stone is being fragmented successfully and we are continuing lithotripsy until the calculus is completely fragmented. To facilitate the stone removal, I'm performing a 10mm balloon sphincteroplasty. With that done, I'm using a 12-15mm stone retrieval balloon to sweep the bile duct and remove the stone debris. Several balloon sweeps are... I've done several balloon sweeps now and we were able to remove the stone fragments completely. Just to confirm, I'm performing an occlusion cholangiogram and it shows that there are no remaining stones or filling defects. The bile duct is clear and there are no further interventions needed at this time. I'm now withdrawing the scope and the procedure is complete. The estimated blood loss is minimal. No complications, no immediate complications can be observed. This is the end of procedure."
spyglass07," Today is 17th of September 2024 and we're here at the endoscopy suite in the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center. This is Dr. Venkat Akshintala and we're performing an ERCP with sphincterotomy and spike glass clangioscopy and stone removal on a 68-year-old female person for evaluation therapy for bile duct still. The patient has a past medical history of GERD, epigraphic abdominal pain that was treated with antispasmodics and she has symptoms of dysphagia. Recent laboratory workup showed elevated liver enzymes with the total bilirubin being 0.5 mg per deciliter. The ALP is 211, AAC is 123, and the ALT is 256. Further evaluation with the MRI-MRCP on the 26th of August 2020 showed tartures and approximately dilated common bile duct that measures 1.2 cm, post cholecystectomy, tiny shot segment, 0.9 cm focal thickening, abrupt termination of the CBD, possible filling defect on the CBD, 4 mm stone on the cystic duct remnant. The patient underwent EOS which confirmed the presence of a CVD calculus. IV sedation is now being administered and I am going to commence the procedure. I am commencing the procedure. I am advancing the Pentex ED3490K duodenoscope to the mouth and passing it into the east phase which appears normal, though limited views. I'm advancing into the stomach now, also appears to be normal and limited use. I'm directing the scope into the second portion of the duodenum. Prior scout film of the abdomen has been performed. The duodenoscope is advanced into the major papilla without detailed examination of the upper geoid tract. The major papilla appears normal but has a long infinitum requiring a long scope position. I'm proceeding with biliary cannulation. I'm attempting to cannulate the CBD with a sphincterotome I preloaded with a hydrojag wire. The pancreatic duct is, I've unintentionally cannulated the pancreatic duct. 5 French 3 centimeter pancreatic duct stent is placed for pancreatitis profile axis. I'm now using a double guide wire technique to successfully cannulate the bile duct. Contrast injection under fluoroscopic guidance shows a mildly dilated CBD, a filling defect confirming the presence of a CBD calculus, a torture of CBD but no evidence of stricturing, non-dilated intrahepatic ducts. I am now performing a 4mm biliary sphincterotomy using ERBE electrocautery with no bleeding that can be observed. To facilitate the stone removal, I'm performing an 8mm balloon sphincteroplasty. I'm then using a 12mm stone retrieval balloon to perform multiple balloon sweeps, successfully removing the stone. Now advancing the spikeless digital cholangioscope, I'm examining the common bile duct, the common hepatic duct, and branches next to the hilum. I can't find any abnormalities, mast lesions, or strictures in the bile ducts. I'm taking biopsies from the distal CBD for further evaluation. Injecting contrast to confirm filling defects. The final contrast injection confirms that there are no remaining filling defects. I'm now withdrawing the spikeless cholangioscope and diadenoscope. The estimated blood loss is minimal. The patient appears to be stable. There appears to be no complications whatsoever. This is the end of the procedure."
pdstone04," Today is the 17th of September 2024 and we're here at the Endoscopy Suite at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. This is Dr. Venkat Akshintala and we're performing an ERCP with removal and destruction of the pancreatic duct calcilla using electrohydraulic lipotripsy, EHL, on a 56-year-old female who's presenting for treatment of a large pancreatic duct stone. The patient has history of hypertension, sarcoidosis, uterine fibroids. She has had recurrent abdominal pain for the past year. There has been no prior history of acute pancreatitis. On recent imaging, chronic pancreatitis was identified with large calculi within the pancreatic duct. And dilated pancreatic duct was present as well. atrophic pancreas, multiple parenchymal calcifications, no diabetes or exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, chronic pancreatitis likely due to 30 plus years of smoking, but she is now quit. She went to ERCP on 7th November 2019, where a pancreatic sphincterotomy was performed. The large pancreatic duct catalyst could not be removed. Plastic pancreatic duct stent for please. She no return for ERCP, it's spyglass pancreatoscopy and electrohydraulic lithotripsy. After verifying, we are now commencing the procedure. Intravenous sedation has been administered. I am advancing the, commencing the procedure. I am advancing the Pentax ED3490 TKD on the mouth. I'm currently passing it through the esophagus, which appears normal though unlimited views. And I'm advancing it into the stomach, also appears normal, unlimited views. I'm directing the scope into the second portion of the duodenum. Scout film of the abdomen has already been performed. I'm now advancing the duodenoscope to the major papilla without detailed examination of the upper GI tract. The scope advances with ease. Previously placed plastic pancreatic duct stents can be visualized. Now proceeding with the stent removal, I'm using a rat tooth forceps to extract the pancreatic duct stents. There seems to be some evidence of prior pancreatic sphincterotomy that can be found. Now proceeding with the pancreatic duct cannulation, I'm using a sphincter room preloaded with a 0.025 inch Visiglide wire. Cannulation is pretty challenging due to the formation of an alpha loop in the pancreatic duct. Advancing the catheter deep into the pancreatic duct is pretty difficult. An angle tip 0.035 in jaguar is what I'     m using to facilitate the pancreatic duct axis. I'm now injecting contrast under fluoroscopic guidance, which reveals a large radiopig stone in the distal body of the pancreas. I'm now advancing the spyglass pancreatoscope over the guide wire into the pancreatic duct where I can see a large calcius. I'm now advancing the EHL probe into the spyglass pancreatoscope to begin the lithotripsy. EHL is attempted using the settings of 15 to 30, basically medium power to high power. Despite multiple attempts now, I'm not able to fragment the stone. Given my inability to fragment the stone with EHL, I am making the decision to discontinue EHL and proceed with ESWL. I am now placing a 7 French 12 cm plastic pancreatic duct stent to localize the catalyst for targeted ESWL. A final contrast injection to confirm that the stent is in good fashion. and it does confirm that the stent is in good condition. I am now withdrawing the SpyGlass, pancreatoscope and duodenoscope. The estimated blood loss is none. The scope is out. The patient appears to be stable. There seems to be no complications. This is the end of procedure."
pdstone06," Today is the 17th of September, 2024, and we're here at the Johns Hopkins Hospital, Bayview Medical Center. This is Dr. Venkat Akshintala, and we're performing an ERCP with stent removal and pancreatic duct dilation. and stent replacement on a 63 year old female presenting for treatment of pancreatic duct structure and stent. The patient has history of idiopathic chronic calcified pancreatitis with pancreas divisum, pancreatic duct calculi, ESWR for stent fragmentation and ERCP with pancreatic duct stent placement in March of 2017, followed by stent removal, recent hospitalization for acute pancreatitis with an obstructing dorsal duct stone, ERCP on the 2nd of August 2019 with the placement of 7 French 8cm plastic single pigtail pancreatic duct stent. Recent hospitalizations for abdominal pain earlier this week. She also has elevated lipase that is 3 times the normal, but there are no clear signs of acute pancreatitis on imaging. She has a previously placed pancreatic duct stent which is noted to have migrated into the diag. Chronic persistent abdominal pain since 2019 that has been worsened by oral intake. She has no history of diabetes or diarrhea. The patient is referred here for ERCP to remove the migrated stent, assess pancreatic duct stricture, and place a new stent. I'm commencing the procedure. IV sedation has been administered. I'm advancing the Olympus TGFQ180B duodenoscope through the mouth. Passing it into the esophagus, which appears normal on limited views. And I'm now advancing into the stomach, which also appears to be normal. I'm directing the scope into the second portion of the diodma. The scout film of the abdomen has been performed. I'm advancing the diodmoscope to the major papilla, without detailed examination of the upper GI tract. The diodmoscope advances with ease. The previously placed plastic dorsal pancreatic duct stent is in situ but has migrated with most of the stent extruding into the TRD. Now proceeding with the stent removal, the plastic pancreatic duct stent has been removed using rat tooth forceps, which is what I used. Now proceeding with the pancreatic duct cannulation, I'm using a sphincterotome preloaded with a 0.035 inch diaguada. The pancreatic duct is successfully cannulated. Contrast injection under fluoroscopic guidance showed a sharp stricture in the head of the pancreas, a likely calculus around the region of the stricture, diffuse dilation of the pancreatic duct upstream, and extensive irregularity of the side branches. Now, proceeding with pneumatic dilation of the pancreatic duct stricture, I'm using a 6mm hurricane balloon to dilate the pancreatic duct stricture as I head to the pancreas. Contrast flow shows a small amount of stone debris or proteinaceous material flowing from the pancreatic duct. Given the presence of a persistent pancreatic duct stricture, I'm now placing a 7 French x 8cm single pigtail plastic pancreatic duct stent, a 5 French x 7cm straight plastic pancreatic duct stent. A 5 hour contrast injection confirms that both stents are in a good position. I am now withdrawing the scope, the duodenoscope, the estimated blood loss is minimal to none. The patient appears to be stable with no complications. The scope is out and this is the end of the procedure."
pdstone08," Today is the 17th of September 2024 and we're in the endoscopy suite at the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center. This is Dr. Venkat Akshintala and we are performing an ERCP with sphincterotomy on a 37-year-old male presenting for treatment of obstructive pancreatic ductal stones in the setting of chronic calcific pancreatitis related to alcohol and smoking. The patient has history of chronic calcific pancreatitis related to alcohol and smoking, obstructive pancreatic ductal stones. The CD pancreas protocol from April 9, 2019 showed persistent coarse calcification of the pancreatic head with mild ductal dilation of up to 6 mm. Previous ERCP in November of 2016 confirmed pancreas division. Plastic stents were removed from both dorsal and ventral pancreatic ducts. The patient has referred for repeat ERCP for pancreatic duct stone removal. IV sedation has been administered and I'm now commencing the procedure. I'm using the Olympus TJF Q180D duodenoscope. I'm now advancing the duodenoscope through the mouth, passing it through the esophagus, which appears normal in limited views, and I'm advancing it into the stomach. where there is a small amount of solid food debris in the pre-pylorus region and antrum. I'm directing the scope into the second portion of the duodenum, which appears under remarkable and unlimited views, except for a duodenal diverticulum along the medial wall of the descending duodenum. The major papilla is located inside this diverticulum. I'm now using a sphincterome preloaded with a 0.035 inch guide wire to attempt pancreatic ductal cannulation. The initial guide wire entry advanced into the bile duct instead of the pancreatic duct. I'm now advancing a guide wire into the right hepatic bile duct. The cholangiogram shows intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation and moderate to severe extrahepatic biliary dilation. A benign appearing mid to distal biliary stricture is noted, likely secondary to chronic calcitic pancreatitis. Bile and contrast drainage appears sluggish. I'm leaving the biliary guide wire in situ and I'm proceeding with pancreatic duct cannulation using the double guide wire technique. Despite multiple attempts at deep pancreatic ductal cannulation through the major papilla, I am unsuccessful. I am now injecting contrast into the ventral duct. The ventral duct appears attenuated, consistent with a complete pancreas division. I am now attempting to cannulate the dorsal pancreatic duct via the minor papilla. After multiple attempts in both short and long positions, the minor papilla cannot be identified. Given the difficulty in visualizing the pancreatic orifice, I am proceeding with biliary sphincterotomy using a 30mm cutting wire and blended electrosurgical current. The biliary sphincterotomy has been performed successfully. There is excellent bile and contrast drainage after sphincterotomy. Despite biliary sphincterotomy to improve exposure, pancreatic duct cannulation remains unsuccessful at both the major and minor papilla levels. At this point, given the prolonged procedure time and persistent failure to achieve pancreatic duct cannulation, I am aborting the procedure. I am now withdrawing the duodenoscope. There is minimal blood loss. The scope is out. The patient appears to be stable and there are no complications. This is the end of the procedure."

IV sedation has been administered and I'm now commencing the procedure. I'm using an Olympus IJFQ180V duodenal endoscope. I'm now advancing the scope through the mouth, passing it into the esophagus, which appears normal on limited views. And I'm continuing to advance it into the stomach, which also appears normal. The duodenum is visualized, appearing normal with no major or minor papillary lesions. The scope is now directed into the second portion of the duodenum. I'm using a sphincterotome preloaded with a 0.035 inch guide wire for initial cannulation. The guide wire initially enters the bile duct instead of the pancreatic duct. I'm advancing the guide wire into the right intrahepatic bile duct. The cholangiogram shows a normal intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile duct. A biliary sphincterotomy is now performed using a 30mm cutting wire with blended electrosurgical current. There is no active post-sphincterotomy bleeding, but mild self-limited oozing is observed. Now I am attempting to cannulate the pancreatic duct through the major papilla. The pancreatic duct unfortunately cannot be successfully cannulated. and so on. I am now shifting my attention to the minor papilla for an alternative approach. A sphincterotome preloaded with 0.035 inch guide wire is what I am using to attempt dorsal or accessory pancreatic duct cannulation through the minor papilla. Despite multiple attempts, the guide wire does not advance. A pre-cut minor sphincterotomy is performed using a triple lumen needle knife. However, the pancreatic duct cannulation remains unsuccessful. Now I'm trying to review the patient's abdominal imaging which shows no evidence of pancreatic divisive. Given the continued difficulty, I'm escalating the multiple alternative techniques to achieve pancreatic duct access. Since I'm using multiple alternative techniques, I'm trying... I'm using a sphincterotome and a needle knife. Both 0.035 inch and 0.025 inch guide wires. I'm using them both. I've used both of them separately. The double wire technique is used to assist pancreatic duct cannulation with the biliary guide wire left in place. The patient's position is changed to prone from semi-prone to improve anatomical alignment. I'm now using biopsy forceps to remove the redundant tissue of the pancreatic duct orifice. Despite three hours of persistent attempts, the pancreatic duct cannulation remains unsuccessful. At this point, I'm deciding to abort the procedure. I'm now withdrawing the duodenoscope. The estimated blood loss is minimal. The scope is out. The patient appears to be stable with no complications. This is the end of procedure."

We're stone removal on a 41-year-old female who's presenting for treatment of alcoholic chronic obstructive pancreatitis with a large stone in the head of the pancreas. The patient initially presented with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. After a very short time, I'm now commencing the procedure. Intravenous sedation has been administered, and I'm advancing the olfactory JFQ180B duodenal scope through the mouth. I'm passing it into the esophagus, and then into the stomach, both of which appear normal, unlimited peace. I'm directing the scope now into the second portion of the duodenum. The scout film of the abdomen has been performed prior to the diurnoscope insertion and it appears normal. The diurnoscope is now being advanced to the major papillom with a detailed examination of the upper gibe. Now, I'm able to see that the main transatlantic duct has been successfully cannulated using a sphincterotome freeloader with 0.025 inch Visiglide 1 guide wire. I'm attempting a deep pancreatic duct cannulation, but the guide wire repeatedly keeps calling in the head of the pancreas. I'm performing a pancreatogram, which shows a tortuous and dilated main pancreatic duct with large, improductable filling defects in the head. The guide wire can't be advanced past the obstructing stone. However, contrast of the duct in the body and the tail is noted, suggesting partial rather than complete obstruction. I am now performing a complete pancreatic sphincterotomy using a 30mm cutting wire and a blended electro-surgical current. There is self-limit bleeding from the sphincterotomy site, which spontaneously stopped within a few minutes. I'm now advancing this Spyglass DS digital pancreatic scope and I'm carefully examining the main pancreatic duct. I'm able to find that there's a large stone that's obstructing and is in the pancreatic head. I'm attempting to start electrohydrology for TRIPSY, but the positioning challenges are preventing me from having a stable end phase. and the visualization of the stone. The spyglass and EHL probe keep repeatedly falling out of position and require repeated pre-pancreatic cannulation. After repositioning, I am able to fragment a large stone using EHL at medium power at the origin of the uncinnate branch of the pancreatic duct. I can see that there are small pancreatic stone fragments draining from the pancreatic orifice. Despite these maneuvers, I am still unable to deeply advance the guide wire past the obstructing stone. Due to carbon dioxide retention and prolonged procedure time, I am making the decision to terminate the procedure. I am now withdrawing the spyglass, pancreatoscope, and diatomoscope.

Recurrent acute pancreatitis at an outside hospital in October 2019. He also has decreased appetite and abdominal pain but no fever or leucocytosis. Abdominal imaging shows organized multilaculated collections by the body and the tail of the pancreas, large calcifications in the pancreatic duct, and dilated pancreatic duct upstream with the stricture. The patient has referred for ERCP to treat the pancreatic duct stone and provide transvascular drainage for the peripancreatic collection. We are now commencing the procedure. IV sedation has been administered. I am advancing the Olympus TGF Q180V duodenal scope through the mouth, passing it into the esophage, which appears normal and limited views. And I am advancing into the stomach, which also appears normal and limited views. I am directing the scope into the second portion of the duodenum.

Abdominal imaging findings shows organized multilocular collections around the body and tail of the pancreas, large calcifications of the pancreatic duct, extreme pancreatic duct dilation with associated strictures. Given these findings, the patient is referred to ERCP to treat the pancreatic duct stone and provide reinfection of bacteria and pancreatic collection to a trans-tacular unit. We are now commencing the procedure. IV sedation has been administered. I'm advancing the Olympus TJF Q180B duodenoscope through the mouth and passing it into the esophagus, which appears normal and limited use, and advancing to the stomach, which also appears normal and limited use. I'm directing the scope into the second portion of the duodenum. The sculpting of the abdomen has been performed. Duodenoscope is advanced to the major papilla without detailed examination of the upper GI tract. The scope is advanced with ease. Both the major and minor papilla appear normal. The question in favor is the cannulation of the minor papilla. Proceeding with the pancreatic duct cannulation, I'm using a sphincterotome preloaded with a 0.025 inch Visiglide wire. Contrast injection under fluoroscopic guidance shows a mildly dilated dorsal pancreatic duct with minimal side branch dilation. Filling defects are consistent with pancreatic duct alfali, pancreatic duct anatomy is consistent with incomplete pancreas divisive. The ventral duct is noted to be tortured. Now I'm advancing the spyglass digital pancreatoscope and carefully examining the dorsal pancreatic duct and side branches. I can see multiple calcified chalcoli in the dorsal pancreatic duct. The pancreatic duct lining appears to be normal. The side branches appear to be normal as well. To facilitate stone removal, I'm performing electrohydraulic lithotripsy to fragment the pancreatic duct stone. Stone fragments are not successfully removed using flushing and balloon strips. The pancreatoscope is advanced into the distal body and tail. A final pancreas injection confirms a clear pancreatic duct with no remaining stones. I'm now withdrawing the spikeless pancreatoscope and the diadenoscope. The estimated blood loss is minimal. The patient appears to be stable and there appear to be no complications. This is the end of procedure."

This is Dr. Venkat Akshintala, and we're performing an ERCP with sphincterotomy and pancreatic stone removal on a 51-year-old female, prescinding for treatment of pancreatic duct calculi. The patient has a history of anxiety, depression, asthma, hypertension, hypodermia, COPD, and alcohol abuse. Chronic pancreatitis due to alcohol use and smoking, complicated by diabetes. Pancreatic duct calculus with intermittent abdominal pain. Fecal elastase is 205. Last ERCP was on the 13th of May 2019. She was diagnosed with pancreatic duct in the pancreatic genu, precluding deep cannulation. Since she has undergone two sessions of ESWL, she currently denies chronic abdominal pain or signs of exocrine pancreatic institutions. The patient has referred to us for a PDRCP to assess and remove the pancreatic duct calculi. IV sedation has been administered and I'm now commencing the procedure. I'm using the Olympus TJF Q180B duodenoscope and I'm advancing it through the mouth, passing it through the esophagus, which is normal on limited views, and advancing it into the stomach, which also appears normal to me. I'm dragging the scope into the second portion of the duodenum. A scout film of the abdomen has been obtained. The previously placed stent, I'm not able to visualize that, suggesting a spontaneous migration. There appears to be minimal distortion of the duodenal apex, but the duodenoscope traverses this area without resistance. The major papilla is identified, and there is no visible pancreatic duct stent. Now proceeding with the pancreatic duct cannulation. A sphincterotome is preloaded with a 0.0825 inch guide wire and I'm attempting to use it for cannulation. The guide wire does not advance deeply into the pancreatic duct due to obstruction by a calculus or stricture. Not sure. Contrast injection opacifies the pancreatic duct into the body of the tail. Despite multiple attempts, deep pancreatic duct cannulation is not achieved. Proteinaceous debris and small stone fragments are seen draining with the contrast. There is an answer loop with the pancreatic duct with a distal obstructing stone or structure. During pancreatic duct cannulation attempts, I unintentionally cannulated the bile duct. Making the decision to attempt cannulation of the main primary duct through the accessory duct. I'm able to identify the minor papilla. Attempt to cannulate the accessory duct with sphincter preloaded with 80.025 inch drag wire is unfortunately unsuccessful. A needle knife minor sphincterotomy. I'm performing a needle knife minor sphincterotomy to facilitate deep cannulation. Contrast injection shows a flow into the main pancreatic duct, but deep cannulation is still not achieved. I'm now attempting deep pancreatic duct cannulation using a Soehendra stent retrieval device. I have recandylated the pancreatic ducts. A 7 French Soehendra stent retrieval device is used to attempt deep access through screw dilation of the genu. Despite multiple attempts, deep pancreatic duct cannulation is not possible. I have successfully removed the pancreatic deflations, small stone fragments. but deep pancreatic duct access remains limited due to anaesthetic challenges. I'm now drawing the scope, the duodenoscope, sorry. The estimated blood loss is none. To minimal. I have, the scope is out. The patient appears to be stable with no complications. This is the end of procedure."

The patient has a history of recurrent acute pancreatitis complicated by chronic calcific pancreatitis due to heavy smoking and moderate alcohol use. No signs of diabetes or exocrine insufficiency. Chronic abdominal pain has been worsening over the past year. She has symptoms of dysmotility including bloating and intermittent constipation. She has had multiple abdominal surgeries. She has anxiety and depression. She's been receiving assistance for smoking cessation and has been undergoing treatment for depression as well. She's on neuromodulators, pregabalin to be precise, for pain management. For pancreatic ductal calculi, she previously underwent extracorporeal shockwave with atripsy on January 9, 2020 and now presents for ERCP. I'm now commencing the procedure. IV sedation has been administered. I'm advancing the Olympus TJFP180V duodenoscope through the mouth and passing it into the esophagus, which appears normal on limited views. I'm advancing into the stomach, which also appears to be normal. I'm directing the scope into the second portion of the duodenum. A scout film of the abdomen has been performed. I'm now advancing the duodenoscope to the major papilla without detailed examination of the upper GI tract. The major papilla appears normal in appearance. Now proceeding with the pancreatic duct cannulation, I'm using a sphincterotome preloaded with a 0.035 inch guide wire. The pancreatic duct has been successfully cannulated. Contrast injection under fluoroscopy guidance shows a minimally dilated pancreatic duct. No remaining pancreatic stones are visible. Proximal stricture is noted in the pancreatic head. I am now performing a pancreatic sphincterotomy using ERBE electrocardi. There is no significant bleeding from the sphincterotomy site. Next I'm attempting to dilate the MPD stricture sequentially from the ampulla to the mid body using a 4mm hurricane balloon. Now I'm placing a 7 French 8cm single pigtail plastic pancreatic stent across the stricture. I'm confirming with fluoroscopy that the stent is in a good portion. The stent is in a good portion, confirmed by fluoroscopy. I'm using contrast now to check the flow. Final contrast injection confirms good bile and pancreatic flow with no residual filling defects. I'm now withdrawing the duodenoscope. The procedure is now complete. The estimated blood loss is none and the patient is stable with no complications. End of procedure."

The patient has elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin. My name is Dr. Venkat Akshintala and the procedure today is going to be an ERCP with sphincterotomy and papillotomy, ERCP with balloon dilation and ERCP with removal of sludge and stent placement. The patient recently had a hospital admission for COVID-19 and acute pancreatitis. CD scan and MR-MRCP show distal common bile duct stone with associated intrahepatic, intra and extra hepatic biliary ductal dilation. We are now commencing the procedure. IV sedation has been administered. We are using the Pentax ED3490TK duodenoscope. I'm introducing the scope to the mouth. And it was passed to the esophagus. and I'm further advancing it from the esophagus into the stomach. Here I can see a normal stomach. Scout film prior to the endoscope insertion appear to be normal as well. From the stomach I'm directing the scope towards the second portion of the duodenum. The major papilla located in the second portion of the duodenum appears to be normal. I'm attempting a bile duct cannulation using a sphincterotome and guide wire. The cannulation of the bile duct was performed with ease. I have achieved deep cannulation successfully. Cholangiogram performed just now, which showed that the biliary tree appeared to be normal with no evidence of stone-tripling defects. It also showed normal CBD, CHD, and intrahepatic ducts. I'm introducing the guide wire to the bile duct to perform a biliary sphincterotomy. I'm using a stone extraction balloon to attempt stone extraction. I've introduced the balloon and dilating it to 8.5 millimeters and 11.5 millimeters. I swept the bile duct multiple times. I've removed the sludge from the bile duct. There's a small ampullon that's concerned about further extending. The papilla was dilated with a CRE 6, 7, and 8 millimeters. biliary plastic stent, a balloon sphincteroplasty was performed using 6mm, 7mm, and 8mm CRE balloon. Balloon occlusion cholangiogram was performed, which appeared to be normal, with no evidence of stimulant or freeing defects. Using 8.5mm and 11.5mm, I am performing a balloon sweep. I have swept the bile duct several times. The sludge was removed from the bile duct, and a 7 French 5cm Cook Zimmon double pigtail biliary plastic stent was placed at the site. A single stent was placed. The scope is really okay. I'm now withdrawing the scope. The scope is out. The estimated blood loss is none and the patient appears to be stable with no complications. This is the end of the procedure."
bdstone10," Today is the 18th of September 2024 and I'm Dr. Venkat Akshintala here at the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center. And I'm performing an ERCP on a 58-year-old male who's here for follow-up of bile duct stones and removal of a previously placed biliary stent. The patient underwent an ERCP with stent placement in February of 2019, followed by a recent cholecystectomy. He now presents for stent removal and evaluation of any residual stones. Timeout has been performed and IV sedation has been administered and I'm now commencing the procedure. I'm now advancing the Dupontax ED3490TK duodenoscope to the mouth. I'm in the esophagus, which appears to be normal. I'm advancing it further into the stomach, performing a retroflex view. And I can confirm that the cardia and the fundus appears normal. I'm continuing to the antrum. through to the first portion and the second portion of the duodenum, which are both unremarkable. The scout film confirms the presence of a previously placed biliary stent, which appears partially migrated within the common bile duct. There is no pancreatic stent visible in fluoroscopy or the ampulla. Using rat tooth forceps, I'm now removing the old stent. The stent was removed without difficulty. I am now attempting biliary duct cannulation using a sphincterome preloaded with a 0.025 inch guide wire. Cannulation is proving to be somewhat difficult due to the presence of a known periampillary diverticulum. I'm multiple attempts in now and after several attempts I'm able to successfully advance the guide wire into the left intrahepatic duct. A 9-12 mm extraction balloon is what I am now advancing and I am performing multiple balloon sweeps of the bile duct. The sweeps are yielding sludge but no stones and occlusion cholangiogram is now being performed. The cholangiogram revealed a non-dilated CBD with no evidence of bile leak. The cystic duct is opacified and noted to have low insertion. I can see that the bile flow is excellent with good contrast drainage. At this point I am withdrawing the scope completely. The scope is out and this is the end of procedure."

We're here with a 31-year-old male on whom we're performing an ERCP. He presents for the treatment of bile duct stones. The patient has a prior history of suspected gallstone pancreatitis and recurrent episodes of biliary type pain, which are on this, occurring every two to three months since his initial episode. He presented this time with more severe prolonged pain, chills and sweats. Lab results were notable for bilirubin of 6.6, alkaline phosphatase of 158, AST of 223 and ALT of 698. MRCP confirmed a likely distal common bile duct stroke. IV sedation has been administered and I am now commencing the procedure. I'm advancing the Olympus TJF Q180V duodenoscope through the mouth, passing it into the esophagus, which appears to be normal, and further into the stomach. I'm advancing the scope into the second portion of the duodenum. The visualized portions of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum are unremarkable. A scout film obtained prior to insertion appears to be normal. The major papilla is identified in the second portion of the duodenum and is small in appearance. I am now attempting bile duct cannulation using a sphincter and a guide wire. Initially, the pancreatic duct is cannulated prior to successful bile duct cannulation. Deep cannulation of the bile duct is now achieved and I am injecting contrast. and a stent test. The cholangiogram reveals a 12 mm stone in the distal common bile duct with upstream dilation of CBD to 10 mm. With the guide wire in position within the bile duct, I am now performing a small biliary sphincterotomy. I am going on to perform a balloon sphincteroplasty using a 10 mm hurricane balloon. Now I'm using a 12mm stone extraction balloon to attempt stone retrieval. I performed two balloon sweeps of the bile duct and I managed to successfully remove a single 12mm stone from the bile duct. I'm performing a balloon occlusion cholangiogram now. And I'm able to confirm that there are no remaining stones or filling defects. Contrast clearance is good. At this point I believe I'm concluding the procedure and beginning withdrawal of the scope. The scope is out. The estimated blood loss was none.

I'm treating him for bile duct stone. He's a Chinese-speaking patient with a history of bilirath to anatomy for PUD from the 1980s. He's also been recently diagnosed with COVID. He's COVID positive in August of 2020. Has atrial fibrillation flutter, not on anticoagulant drugs. Bradycardia status post-pacemaker in 2017. CKD2 baseline nonverbal dementia, is PEG dependent, and has vocal cord paralysis from a thyroidectomy in 1995. He was admitted to Howard County for sepsis secondary to multilobar aspiration pneumonia and ascending coli diagnosis with E. coli sepsis. Initially he was in the ICU and was later transferred to the floor, saturating on Tuller's NC. His CD confirmed CBD stones and he was transferred to the Johns Hopkins Hospital for ERCP in the setting of altered anatomy. We performed his ERCP on the 16th of December 2020 which confirmed a large distal bile duct stone and given its size we placed a stent. Today we are going to do a repeat ERCP with EHL. IV medication has been administered and we are now commencing the procedure. Reducing the Olympus TJF Q180B duodenoscope and I'm advancing the scope through the mouth into the esophagus, which I see is normal. I'm advancing the scope further to the stomach, also appearing normal, aside from the bilirath to anatomy. I'm then directing the scope into the second portion of the duodenum. The scope from where the abdomen has been formed appears to be normal. The duodenoscope has advanced the major papilla with a detailed examination of the upper genitract. I note that the afferent limb is in the 10 o'clock position. I see the previously placed bile duct stent in place. I am then attempting to remove the stent using rat tooth forceps. I notice evidence of prior biliary sphincterotomy. I have now achieved successful biliary cannulation using a sphincterotome preloaded with 0.025 inch guide wire. I'm injecting contrast and can observe a 2 cm calculus in the distal bile duct. I'm now loading a digital cholangioscope into the duodenoscope channel and advancing it. I'm carefully examining the common bile duct, the common hepatic duct, and the branches near the hilum. I can see that the distal CPD contains a large calculus, which is partially fragmented, likely due to the previously placed stent. I'm now attempting to perform an electrohydraulic lithotripsy under normal saline irrigation. I can see that the calculus is completely fragmented. I'm now attempting to perform a 10mm balloon sphincteroplasty to facilitate the stone removal. I'm advancing a 12-15mm stone retrieval balloon and performing several sweeps, completely removing all the stone fragments. I'm going to go ahead and perform an occlusion cholangiogram. which shows no residual stones or filling defects. I am now commencing withdrawal of the scope. The scope is out.

An ultrasound for November of 2020 showed multiple stones on the gallbladder and her intra- and extrahepatic biliary tree were distended with a possible common bile duct stone. A CT scan demonstrated that the CBD is dilated to 1.5 cm, though no mass or stone was evident on that imaging. An MRCP showed a dilated CBD in intra-hypnotic ducts with a mid-CPD stone. She is scheduled for colostectomy tomorrow. Timeout has been completed and IV sedation has been administered and I'm commencing the procedure. I'm now advancing the Pentax ED3490 TK duodenoscope through the patient's mouth into the esophagus, which I see is normal and I'm now heading to the stomach. I'm directing the scope into the second portion of the duodenum. The stomach also appears to be normal and I'm now in the second portion of the duodenum. I did perform a scout film of the abdomen which appears to be normal prior to endoscopic insertion. I'm advancing the duodenal scope to the major papilla with a detailed examination of the upper GI tract. I note that the major papilla is located in the second portion of the duodenum and appears small in appearance. I can also see that there is bile draining from the papilla. I'm beginning biliary cannulation using sphincterotome with a 0.035 inch hydriger guide wire. Cannulation of the bile duct is easy and I'm able to achieve deep cannulation. I do not cannulate the pancreatic duct. I'm injecting contrast and the cholangiogram shows a single stone in the mid-CBD. The cholangiogram also demonstrates a prominent CBD measuring about 10 millimeters. I see that the cystic duct and the gallbladder are partially opacified.

The patient has a previous history of end-stage renal disease, secondary congenital nephriotic syndrome, for which she underwent renal transplant in 2007. but unfortunately experienced graft failure in 2019. Additionally, he has cirrhosis with atragiocular intrahepatic photosystemic shunt tips. In December of 2019, he underwent ERCP for polydocolithiasis, during which a 10 French cross 7 centimeter plastic biliary stent was placed. He subsequently underwent polycystectomy in February of 2020. Recently imaging confirmed that the biliary stent remains in place and that his liver function tests are normal. He is now presenting for stent removal. Intravenous sedation has been administered and I am now commencing the procedure. I am advancing the Olympus TJFP 180V duodenum swab through the mouth and passing it into the esophagus which appears normal. I'm continuing it into the stomach which also appears normal in limited use and I'm now further advancing the scope into the second portion of the duodenum. Scout film obtained confirms the presence of surgical clips in the right upper quadrant and the previously placed plastic bile duct stent. I'm now visualizing the major papilla and using rat tooth forceps I'm going to remove the plastic biliary stent. I was able to remove it without any resistance. There is evidence of prior biliary sphincterotomy. I'm now going to go ahead and deeply cannulate the bile duct using a 9-12mm stone retrieval balloon that is preloaded with a 0.035 inch guide wire. I'm performing an occlusion cholangiogram now and there seems to be no evidence of filling defects or bile leak. However, I am noting that the right hepatic ducts appear to be rotated and displaced, likely due to a tibs placement and a carted hypertrophy. The right hepatic ducts are not clearly delineated from the common hepatic ducts. To improve this visualization, I am repositioning the patient from supine to left lateral decubitus. I am now using an 8mm hurricane balloon to straighten and sweep the right anterior hepatic duct. There is good bile and contrast flow and no obvious stricture is seen. The previously noticed stricture appears to have resolved. The common bile duct, the common hepatic duct, the right and left main hepatic ducts are non-dilated. There are no filling defects. Multiple balloon sweeps of the bile duct were performed. This yielded a small amount of sludge but no stone so there is excellent bile and contrast drainage.
