cyst03," This is Dr. Venkat Akshanthala dictating the procedure for an operandoscopic ultrasound with fine needle aspiration and EGD, esophageal gastrodiagnoscopy with biopsy performed on a female patient, test for whose date of birth is the 20th of August 1981 and medical record number is 3446548. The procedure is being conducted at the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center and today is the 17th of January 2025. The patient's a 62 year old female who's presenting for evaluation of GERD and an incidentally discovered pancreatic head cyst on previous imaging. We're using the the EG29I10 and EG34J10U endoscopes. We are now commencing the procedure. I am now introducing the high def endoscope through the mouth and advancing it under direct visualization. visualization. As I pass the scope through the esophagus, I can observe a LA grade C esophagitis with mucosal breaks involving more than 75% of the circumference, but I can't see any deep alterations. It's involving 75% of the circumference but without deep alterations. There is also a 2 cm high atrial hernia. It could be classified as a Hill Grade 3. There is no proximal inlet patch that I can see. The esophageal mucus otherwise appears to be normal with no nodularity, strictures or masses. I am biopsying the mid and the proximal esophagus to rule out eosinophilic esophageitis. Glycolysis. The gastroesophageal junction is noted at 33 cm from the incisors with a diaphragm pinch noted at 35 cm. I'm now advancing the scope into the stomach. The gastric mucosa appears to be normal with no ulcers, erosions or mast lesions. I'm taking random biopsies here to rule out Helicobacter pylori infections. I'm now continuing to advance the scope into the first and second portions of the duodenum, where the mucus appears to be normal here, without any erythema, ulcerations or villous blunting. I'm now withdrawing the gastroscope and introducing the echo-inter-scope to the patient's mouth. I'm now passing through the esophagus. The mucosa remains unchanged from prior evaluation. It's just the L.A. gritty esophagitis that can be noted. The scope is advanced in the stomach. And I'm now pushing the endoscope in the second portion of the diodium. Pancreatic Pancrema The cyst has no mural nodules, no gallicifications and no obvious connection with the membrane periodic dot. I am using a 22 gauge aspiration needle to perform FNA. I can confirm using color Doppler that no intervening vascular structures are present before beginning the puncture. Beginning the first pass, I'm able to obtain about 60 c of clear viscous fluid that I've aspirated. Oh, two grams of IV of cefetetan was administered prior to the puncture just for good measure for infection prophylaxis. The main pentatonic duct appears to be normal and measures about 3.0 mm in the head and 1.3 mm in the body and 0.6 mm in the tail. I'm now visualizing the bilirubin tree. I can see that the common bile duct is now dilated and measures about 5.1 mm just below the hilum with no stone strictures or abnormalities. The gallbladder appears normal But I can see some micro lithiasis without mural thickening or peripolytistic fluid No peripancreatic, periportal or coelac axis lymph nodes can be visualized Now visualizing the liver and the portions that I'm visualizing in the liver demonstrate a hepatic steatosis with mild blunting of the liver edge There are no mass lesions or intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation. I I can't see any ascites or nodular dipostures either. I'm beginning withdrawal of the scope and re-evaluating the visualized structures on withdrawal. Withdrawal is almost complete and there's no evidence of bleeding. Withdrawal is now complete. There's no immediate complications. The patient appears to be stable. The estimated blood loss is none. This is the end of procedure."
cyst10," This is Dr. Venkatakshan Thala, detailing the procedure for an operandoscopic ultrasound with fine needle aspiration and needle-based confocal laser endomicroscopy performed on a female patient, test 10 with date of birth of August 20, 1981 and medical record number 3446548. The procedure is being conducted at the Johns Hopkins Baby Medical Center on January 17th of 2025. That's today. And we're here with a 61-year-old female patient who's presenting for surveillance of a pancreatic head or uncinate cyst. She previously underwent an EUS on 27th of January in 2023, which demonstrated a 0.7-centimeter cyst in the pancreatic body and a 5.4 x 3.7-centimeter cyst in the pancreatic head or incident process with a mixed macro-microcystic appearance, which was suggestive of a serious cystadenoma. EOSFNA performed at the time was negative for CEA and cytologists showed a mucin. Given these findings, the cyst was likely consistent with a serious cystadenoma. The patient is returning today for ongoing surveillance. So I'm now commencing the procedure. I'm using an Olympus GF-UC-T180 ultrasound. US ultrasound, sorry. I'm introducing the scope through the mouth and advancing it under direct visualization into the esophagus. The mucus here appears to be normal with no nodular erosions or strictures that I can identify. As I advance the scope into the stomach, it appears to be normal. I can't see any ulcers or erosions or mass lesions. I continue advancing the scope into the first and second portion of the diadenum, where the mucus appears to be normal, without any erythema, villus, blunting, or ulcerations. I'm pushing the scope in the second portion of the diadenum to perform a systematic evaluation of the pancreas and the surrounding structures. I'm visualizing the pancreas beginning at the head and tracing it to the tail. The pancreatic pancrema shows mild lobularity and fatty infiltration, particularly in the pancreatic body and tail. I can note some amount of echogenic foca and stranding. The main pancreatic duct is not dilated. It measures about 2.2 mm in the neck and 1.4 mm in the body. The duct can be traced to the ampulla and shows a smooth taper with no evidence of echogenic duct wall thickening. There are no strictures or stones in the duct. No masses or no mass lesion or mucin either. I can't visualize any dilated branch ducts. I can see a 48.7 mm x 49.2 mm lesion in the pancreatic head or uncinebrosis. The lesion has a primarily microcystic appearance with some macrocystic components. Thin walls seem to separate the compartments with no evidence of calcification or a central scar. There is no direct communication of the main pancreatic duct that I can observe. I'm beginning the final aspiration. I'm using a 19 gauge expect needle. I'm using color Doppler to confirm the absence of intervening vascular structures. I'm in. I only performed a single pass. were administered before the puncture for infection prophylaxis. NCLE is being performed now. I administered a 5-amyl of fluorescein dye before the NCLE. On NCLE, no epithelial structures or papillary projection can be visualized. Fine capillaries with a foreign pattern are noted. This is consistent with a serous cystadenoma. I'm visualizing the biliary tree, the common The abdomen bile duct appears to be normal in caliber and appearance. There's no stones or stitches. There appear to be no peripancreatic, perigastric or celiac axis lymph nodes that can be visualized. I'm visualizing the liver and the visualized portion of the liver appear to be normal with no focal lesions or abnormalities. The adrenal gland is what I'm seeing now and the left adrenal gland appears to be normal. I'm beginning withdrawal of the scope now. I'm revaluating all the previously visualized structures on my way back. On withdrawal, there appear to be no other abnormalities than the ones I previously mentioned. There appears to be no evidence of bleeding. The scope is out. The patient appears to be stable. There appears to be no immediate complications. The estimated blood loss is minimal and this is the end of the procedure"
cyst08," This is Dr. Venkatakshan Thala, dictating the procedure for an upper endoscopic ultrasound performed on a female patient, test 8, with date of birth of 20th August 1981, and medical record number is 3446548. The procedure is being conducted on the 17th of January 2025 at the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center. We're here with a 45-year-old female who's presenting for evaluation of an incidentally detected pancreatic cyst on imaging. She has no prior history of pancreatic disease, no family history of pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer. She has no prior history of weight loss, nausea, vomiting, fears, or chills. She's a non-smoker, consumes alcohol in moderation. A prior CD that was performed on the 3rd of November in 2024 showed a very small hypotense lesions in the pancreatic body with a normal pancreatic duct. The patient's undergoing EUS for further evaluation of a pancreatic cyst along with a colonoscopy for colon cancer screening. I'm introducing the pediatric colonoscope and advancing it through to the diadenome. I pass the scope through the esophagus. The mucosa appears to be normal. There appears to be no strictures nor dilarity of erosions. I am in the stomach now, which appears to be normal. There seem to be no ulcers, erosions, or mastletions. As I continue advancing it into the first and second portion of the diadenum, where the mucus appears to be normal without erythema, villus blunting, or ulcerations. I am now introducing the Olympus PCF H190DL endoscope. I am now in the esophagus. The mucus remains unchanged from prior evaluation. I'm advancing the scope into the stomach and I'm now pushing the scope in the second portion of the diatom to perform a systematic evaluation of the pancreas and the seroneic structures. I'm beginning the evaluation of the pancreas at the head and tracing it to the tail. The pancreatic parenchyma appears to be normal with no evidence of mass lesions, hyper-echoic focal strands or calcifications. The main pancreatic duct is not dilated and measures about 1.4 millimeters in the neck, 1.1 millimeters in the body and 1.1 millimeters in the tail. The duct is traced to the ampulla and can be traced to the ampulla and shows a smooth taper with no evidence of echogenic duct wall thickening, mucin, mass lesions, strictures or stones. No dilator branch ducts can be visualized though I can see three pancreatic cysts in the neck of the body. So the first pancreatic cyst in the neck measures about 3.7 millimeters. It's definitely single chambered, it's thin walled without septation, some mural nodules, no calcifications and has communication with the main pancreatic duct. duct. The second cyst in the body, the pancreatic body cyst, sorry, the pancreatic body, the first pancreatic body cyst, and the second cyst in general, it measures about 3.3 millimeters, is well defined, single chambered, thin wall without septations of mural nodules. There is no obvious communication with the main pancreatic duct. The second pancreatic body cyst and the third cyst in general overall measures about 2.7 mm x 6.7 mm. It is well defined. It has two chambers separated by a thin septation. There are no mural nodules, calcifications or connection to the main pancreatic duct. I am now visualizing the biliary tree. The common bile duct appears to be normal in caliber and measures about 4.2 mm. There are no, I can't see any stricture stones or abnormalities. The gallbladder appears to be normal, with no wall thickening stones or pericollis cystic fluid. I can't visualize any peripancreatic, perigastric, or coelac axis lymph nodes. The visualized portions of the liver appear to be normal, with no focal lesions or abnormalities. There seems to be no ascites or nodular deposits that can be seen. The left adrenal gland appears to be normal. Now visualizing the mediastinum. No periesovigil, subcarinal, AP window, periaeotic, subaerotic lymph nodes or masses that can be visualized. I can't see any pleural effusion either. I'm now beginning withdrawal of the scope. Scope On my way back, I'm revaluating all the previously visualized structures. On withdrawal, I'm not able to find any other abnormalities other than the ones that have already been mentioned. There is no evidence of bleeding. The scope is out. There are no immediate complications. The patient appears to be stable. The estimated blood loss is minimal. This is the end of procedure."
cyst06," This is Dr. Venkat Akshanthala dictating a procedure for an upper endoscopic ultrasound performed on a female patient, Tess06, whose date of birth is 20th of August, 1981, and the medical record number is 3446548. The procedure is being conducted at the Johns Hopkins Oslo Center, and today is the 17th January 2025. The patient is a 70-80 year old female who is undergoing surveillance for multiple pancreatic cysts that were initially detected on a cardiac CD in December of 2020. Genetic testing was negative and she remains asymptomatic. The previous EOS in 2021 demonstrated multiple cysts including a 19 millimeter cyst in the body, a 21 x 4.9 mm cyst in the anterior process, a 9 mm cyst in the body, a 17 mm cyst in the tail, a 13 mm cyst in the neck, and a 11 mm cyst in the head with no pancreatic duct dilation. Her most recent MRI and RCP was on 11th of October in 2023, which confirmed multiple pancreatic cysts without apparent nodular or enhancing features, with a serpaginous dilated duct in the uncinated process measuring about 8 mm. Patient has declined EUSFNA unless worrisome features are detected. She is Ashkenazi Jewish with cholera, GD negative and a maternal first cousin with pancreatic cancer. She has declined participation in the CAP study. Using an Olympus GF-UCT180 scope today. I'm advancing this scope under direct visualization after introducing it through the mouth into the esophagus. As I pass the scope through the esophagus, mucus appears to be normal with no strictures or erosion or nodularity. I'm advancing the scope into the stomach, which appears to be normal, with no ulcers, erosions, or mastilations. I'm currently advancing the scope into the first and second portions of the diadenum, where the mucous appears to be normal, with erythema, villus, blunting, or ulcerations. I'm now pushing the endoscope into the second portion of the diadenum to perform a systematic evaluation of the pancreas and the surrounding structures. Pancreatic Parenchyma showing a smooth taper with no ignorance of echogenic duct wall thickening, mucin, mass lesions, strictures or stones. No dilated branch ducts can be visualized. Multiple pancreatic cysts can be identified throughout the pancreas. In the pancreatic tail, there are cysts that measure 3.3 millimeters, 3.1 millimeters, 8 millimeters, 20.8 millimeters. There's another one that measures 9.9 millimeters and another one that measures 12.3 millimeters. All these cysts are well defined. They are single chambered. They are thin walled with acceptation of neural nodules. There is a 14.3 mm pancreatic cyst in the neck of the pancreas with a thin septum that's well defined. With a thin system and septum and the cyst is well defined without any neural nodules. The cyst in the pancreatic head measures about 5.3 mm, is single chambered, well defined, and is thin walled without mural nodules. I can't see any calcifications or any obvious communication with the main pancreatic duct in any of these cysts. I am now visualizing the biliary tree. The common bile duct appears to be normal in caliber and appearance, with no strictures or stones. The gall gland appears to be normal as well, with no wall thickening stones or pericollisistic fluid. There are no peripancreatic, perigastric or celiac axis lymph nodes that can be visualized any. I'm visualizing the liver now. The visualized portions of the liver appear to be normal, with no focal lesions or abnormalities. I can't see any ascites or nardula deposits. To me the left adrenal gland appears to be normal. I'm beginning withdrawal at the scope and I'm revaluating all the structures on my way back. On withdrawal I'm unable to identify any other abnormalities other than the ones I've previously mentioned. The scope is out. There's no evidence of bleeding or any immediate complications. The patient appears to be stable. The estimated blood loss is minimal. This is the end of the video."
cyst02," Today is the 17th of September 2024 and this is Dr. Venkatakshanthala dictating the procedure for an upper endoscopic ultrasound with fine needle aspiration with color doppler. Perform on a male patient whose date of birth is August 20th 1981 with MR number 666666. This is a 69 year old male patient, presenting for an evaluation of a pancreatic cystic lesion. The patient has a significant past medical history of esophageal cancer, left breast cancer, and adrenal cortical adenoma and adrenal hyperplasia. Pancreatic protocol CT from December 30th, 2023, revealed a 1.8 centimeter pancreatic body cyst with a questionable thin septum. The lesion has increased in size since 2019 and this is suspected to be a side branch IPMN. We're now beginning the procedure. I'm introducing the gastroscope. It's an Olympus GIF HQ190 gastroscope. I'm introducing it through the mouth. I'm advancing it through the esophagus Stomach And I'm beginning to evaluate the pancreas using a linear echo endoscope. The pancreatic parenchyma, I'm evaluating it beginning with the head. At the head of the pancreas, it appears to be mildly lobular with echogenic foci and strands consistent with chronic changes. The main pancreatic duct in the head measures about 1.3 mm. It's not dilated. I'm able to see a cyst in the head and the uncinate region. That's about 7 mm in size. It appears to be single chambered. It has thin walls. There's no septation. There are also no neural nodules. There seems to be no evidence of communication between the cysts and the main pancreatic duct. I am retracting the scope slightly to evaluate the pancreatic neck and body. The largest cyst seems to be in the distal body of the pancreas. It measures about 23.7mm x 13.8mm It's a multi-luculated cyst with thin septations and thin walls. There are no mural nodules or calcifications in the cyst. I am confirming with Doppler imaging. and I can say that there are no intervening vascular structures. Using a 22 gauge fine needle, I'm performing a single pass under real trim ultrasound guidance to aspirate fluid from the cyst. I'm able to aspirate about 3 mm. I'm sending this fluid over for molecular marker analysis, CEA and glucose anomalies level analysis as well. The cyst is not collapsing post-aspiration and about 8.3 mm residual portion remains. I'm further tracking the scope to evaluate the pancreatic tail. A single well-defined thin-walled cyst can be seen here. It's about 3.0 mm. There are no mural nodules or septations or calcifications of any kind. It doesn't seem to communicate with the main pancreatic duct. Talking of the main pancreatic duct, it can be traced from the head to the tail. It's about 1.3 mm in the head. It doesn't seem to be dilated. measures about 2.5 mm in the neck and about 1.3 mm in the tail. There seems to be no abnormalities of any kind in the pancreatic duct, in the main pancreatic duct. There are no strictures, tones or thickening that can be identified. I am now visualizing the biliary tree. Common bile duct appears to be normal with no evidence of dilation. Stones are wall thickening. It appears to be three millimeters in diameter. I'm now withdrawing endoscope. Under traction, the diodenum appears to be normal. I'm re-evaluating the stomach as well. The gastric mucosa appears to be normal and And so does the esophagus. There were no abnormalities of any kind noted in the visualized portions of the upper GI tract. I'm now withdrawing the scope. The scope is out. There appear to be no immediate complications. And the blood loss appears to be very minimal. This is the end of procedure."
cyst01," This is Dr. Venkata Akshantala dictating the procedure for an operantoscopic ultrasound with fine needle aspiration performed on a female patient with the date of birth of August 20th, 1981 and medical record number XXXX. The procedure was conducted on September 17th, 2024 at the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center. The patient presented for evaluation of an Incidentally detected pancreatic cyst noted on a CTA dated August 30th, 2024. The imaging revealed a 1 cm subtle hyperdensity in the body of the pancreas and a possible 1.2 cm exophytic lesion in the head of the pancreas. A prior CT scan from July 27th of this year showed a mildly atrophic pancreas without ductal dilation, likely age-related. There is no history of any prior endoscopic ultrasound procedures. I'm today using a Olympus GF UCT 180 EUS curly linear ultrasound endoscope serial number is 713 5502 and I'm now beginning the procedure the scope is in I'm introducing it through the mouth and advancing it carefully through the esophagus now and I'm now in the stomach and into the second portion of the duodenum. During advancement I observed the lumen and the surrounding structures and I can see that there are no abnormalities of any kind. Once the scope, yeah the scope is now in the stomach and I'm infusing water. I'm I'm using a 7.5 MHz frequency today for imaging of the pancreas and I'm able to see multiple anechoic lesions consistent with pancreatic cysts. The largest cyst is in the proximal body around the neck of the pancreas and it measures about 1.1 cm x 0.65 cm. There appear to be no mural nodules or solid components within the cyst, but I can see a thin septation. I'm performing a fine needle aspiration using a 22 gauge needle. FNAC is now complete. I'm using color Doppler to confirm that there are no intervening vascular structures prior to the puncture. FNAC was completed using a single pass. There seems to be minimal fluid, but I'm sending it for molecular marker testing anyway. On the pancreas I can also see a 4.8mm x 6.4mm cyst in the pancreatic head. I am able to see a cyst in the uncinate process as well. It measures about 8.6mm x 9.6mm. I am also able to see another cyst in the pancreatic head. That is about 8.7mm x 5.3mm. There seems to be a 1.5 mm septation within the cyst. There seems to be a cluster of sub-centimeter cysts in the body. The largest measures 6.2 mm x 3.3 mm. In the tail of the pancreas now, there seems to be a 7.9 mm cyst. The main pancreatic duct appears to be normal in diameter. It measures about 1.4 mm in the head, it's under 2 mm in the body and about 1 mm in the tail. There seems to be no evidence of duct wall thickening, there's no strictures, no stones, not any mural nodules. There seems to be some amount of myelobularity and atrophy with echogenic foci and stranding. Moving to the bile duct, it appears to be normal. It measures about 3.1 millimeters. The gallbladder appears to be normal. The diurnum appears to be normal as well. There seems to be no peripancreatic lymphadenopathy. I'm able to visualize the liver and it appears to be normal as well. On withdrawal of the scope, I'm able to see that the stomach and the esophagus are normal as well. I'm now retracting the scope completely. The scope is out. The procedure is now complete. There seems to be no immediate complications. And there seems to be very, very minimal blood loss. This is the end of procedure. you"

Test 07 with a date of birth of August 20th 1981 and medical record number 3446548. The procedure is being conducted at the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center on the 17th of January 2025. The patient's a 84 year old male who's presenting for an evaluation of a pancreatic cyst. We're using the A110101 endoscope. I'm now commencing the procedure. I'm introducing the endoscope through the mouth and advancing a direct visualization. I'm passing the scope through the esophagus. The mucus appears normal here with no strictures, nodularity or erosions. I'm advancing the scope into the stomach. The gastric mucosa appears normal with no ulcers, erosions, or mast lesions here. I'm continuing to advance the scope into the first and second portions of the duodenum. And I can see that the mucosa appears normal here. There's no erythema, villus, blunting, or ulcerations. I'm withdrawing the gastroscope and introducing the endoscope into the patient's mouth. I'm now into the esophagus. The mucosa remains unchanged from prior evaluation. I'm advancing to the stomach. And I'm now pushing the endoscope in the second portion of the duodenum. And I'm beginning systematic evaluation of the pancreas and the surrounding structures. I'm visualizing the pancreas now. beginning of the head and tracing to the tail. I can see a single lobulated anechoic cyst that's measuring greater than 33 millimeters cross 31 millimeters and can be identified at the head of the pancreas with septated components. There's a single nine cross nine millimeter mural nodule within the cyst wall and mucin is present in the other compartments. I'm using a needle-based confocal laser endomicroscopy, the NCLE, using an AQ-FLEX probe via a 19-gauge needle. And that reveals dark papillary projections. I'm also using the 19 gauge needle to perform the final aspiration using a 10cc syringe. I made a total of three passes. The main panther duct is abnormal and measures about five millimeters in the head. Now visualizing the biliary tree, the common bile duct appears to be normal, measuring about three millimeters in diameter. I can't identify any intraluminal caliculi or bilir restrictions. The ampulla appears normal on evaluation. I'm visualizing the liver and the visualized portions of the liver appear to be normal. I can't see any abnormalities or focal issues of any kind. I can't see any peripancreatic or perigastric or celiac access lymph nodes. The visualized portion of the spleen that I'm now looking at appears to be normal. And I'm now beginning with the roll of the scope. I'm also re-evaluating the structures on my way back. There seems to be no evidence of bleeding. The scope is out. There appears to be no immediate complications. The patient appears to be stable. Estimated blood loss is minimal And this is the end of the procedure"
